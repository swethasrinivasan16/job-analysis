They say associates have a voice and they do survey associates, but if you speak up otherwise, do so at your own risk...

2. The company is making great strides towards improving career mobility but many legacy barriers remain in place, including attitudes of hiring managers and their superiors.

3. Very conservative company when it comes to risk...decisions are made by ""committee"" after exhaustive discussions, even over the most smallest and trivial things. Many times your work gets trapped by becoming all about the process and not the outcome.

4. Top Heavy. Appears to be a large population in the lower pay grades, but very few in the middle (managers, sr. managers), and an enormous Director, VP, and above segment. The top segment is all about taking care of each other when not competing or fighting one another.

Don't work here unless you are in asset management. Those are the only people who make any real money.



The tech is severely outdated. Some engineers were working in COBOL while I was there. Once again, this is insulting and shows that no effort is made by management to invest in good tech. 



Management makes it very clear that technologists provide negative value, we were even told this during out first week. ""You are a cost center"" -- I can't tell you how many times I've heard this.

343,"Though the Emerging Leader Program was designed to allow liberal arts graduates to learn about financial services in an ""elite"" program, it has its severe downfalls and ultimately I do not recommend this program to anyone considering starting their career with ELP. My cons are as follows: 



- Commuting: for New England based associates, you are expected to travel to your assigned rotations in either RI, NH, or Boston. These assignments are chosen subjectively by your manager, and you do not know up until 3 or so weeks before your rotation begins. Though you can express interest in rotations that are based in Boston, NOTHING is ever certain or clear, you may be left surprised at your unsatisfying assignment. Not everyone in the program will get assigned a rotation that requires 2+ hours of driving so you may be a part of the unlucky few that is left to drive into the woods for a dark 4 months. You cannot log your miles driven so you do not get reimbursement for gas, the low compensation does not help  cushion the cost either.



- Rotation assignments:  The program  gives associates three 4-month long rotations in different business units within fidelity. If you have an interest in a certain group - finance, strategy, personal investing, etc. there is no certainty that you will be able to work with them as the rotations are assigned by topics - operations, product, and data analytics (which they don't even stick to half the time so it's unorganized). The way these are assigned are subjectively your manager who you share your interests with but they ultimately decide where you will go. You may be left unhappy and confused at what you are assigned and the lack of skills developed in 4 months. Management hammers into you to ""trust the process"" but I caution you not to. The lack of structure to how placements are assigned is the single biggest downfall of the program since final placement is correlated to the work experience you have or haven't been able to build in the past 18 months. 



- Compensation: the comp is way too low for an ""elite"" program and compared to similar programs at other firms!!



-  Diversity and Inclusion: though efforts are being made to advanced inclusion in the firm and program at wide, don't expect Anonymous to be as socially aware as your liberal arts college. You'll find people with similar social consciousness but as a firm they still have a ways to go - though sincere efforts are being made, culture changing is slow at a large firm. This lack of D&I inevitably trickles down to ELP management and the decisions made so enjoy :). 



I see the program thriving in 5-10 years when large structural changes have been made (which are being considered to be transparent).

I joined Anonymous after college as a part of the Emerging Leader Program - a new 18-month rotational program for college graduates based in New England.  The program pros are: 

- Exposure to senior leadership: many 1:1's with VP's, SVP's and executives once in a while

- Opportunity to travel: ad hoc and there is a trip ELP plans to tour the different Anonymous sites

 - Working new jobs/roles: you won't get bored for too long since you are rotating every few months 

- Comradery:  You do the program with other new college grads and you build a great comradery and makes the experience fun as well as gives you great new friends. 

- Connections: different from networking, you will meet great individuals along the path that will be sincerely great mentors, rotational managers, and friends at the firm.","Doesn't Recommend,Negative Outlook,Approves of CEO",3.0,I have been working at Anonymous Investments full-time for more than a year,3.0,1.0,"Current Employee - Associate, Emerging Leader Program",5.0,"September 17, 2019"

360,"Compensation: Compensation is extremely low for the caliber of people they expect to hire for ELP. They told us they did 'comp' research and that we're in line with other liberal arts grads in the business sector, but for the amount of knowledge and commitment they are asking (jumping around different BUs and delivering business value straight away, commuting over 110 miles a day some months) we are grossly underpaid. Several of us have done research and know we can get at least 25% more at any other comparable role. They tell us that our amazing benefits make up for it, but I don't see many of us, right out of college, using home insurance benefits or ""College Success Planning."" Those of us holding out are hopeful that our final placement salaries will be a significant increase. 



Management: Management is not as up-to-par as would be expected for a program that recruits from elite liberal arts colleges. One of the managers has an online degree from a for-profit university and it shows- no critical thought, inability to understand and digest feedback without getting defensive, and has worked her way up using relationship skills without actually being qualified for her position in regard to merit. Her manager, an SVP, is too busy with her other initiatives and only seems to present herself at the ""fun"" opportunities - team-building sessions, orientation, etc. We as a cohort have no insight into what she is doing for the program or if feedback is being relayed up to her at all. Overall, the management team may be well intentioned but lacks clear direction and minimizes transparency in order to hide the fact that they don't really know what they're doing either. 



Rotations: While ELP may present itself as a cool opportunity to explore different functions, expect to be disappointed when finding out where you got placed. Rotations are based on ""business need,"" meaning that while you may express interest in a particular field, you may end up in a completely different field. Management will try to make it seem okay by pointing out the ""positives,"" but it doesn't address the fact that you may potentially waste four months doing something you have no interest in doing and you could've spent doing something that would actually bring some clarity to your career options. 



Final Placement: Placement after the program is supposed to be based the rotation that you matched the most with and enjoyed doing. However, some people get rotations that have no intention of hiring someone from ELP, and get stuck with getting placed in one of their rotations they didn't enjoy or have to scramble to network to see if there are any opportunities available outside of their rotations. Once that process is done and you have your options (assuming you have more than one option), you don't even know salary information until AFTER informally accepting the full-time position- we're supposed to not worry about salary and instead choose the placement option that best ""aligns"" with our career wants. After this informal acceptance, we then get the ""official"" offer letter and sign that. I've never heard of an instance where you don't know salary information before accepting a role, but like in many other cases where things in the program don't make sense, there is always a ""reason"" for the way things are. 



""Trust the Process"" : If I had a penny for every time I heard ""Trust the Process""...this is the term used by management as a palliative for the program's serious structural issues. Hate the rotation you're in? There's a reason why you got it, you just have to trust the process. Is your rotation not even close to what your career goals are? There's a reason for that, trust the process. If you ever hear this phrase, beware!",2.0,"Boston, MA","""Emerging Leader Program""",2.0,"***This review and ratings are oriented towards the Emerging Leader Program, not Anonymous as a firm.***



Meeting Executives: ELP presents several opportunities to meet executives across the firm, and we even have a team Q&A session with the CEO. At the end of the program, we report out a capstone project to all the executives, which is great visibility. 



Enterprise-Wide View: Since you are rotating in all different areas of Anonymous, you get a great view of how the firm functions as a whole. With the firm's initiative to work better as a collective unit (as opposed to silos), this is an opportunity that allows you to bring a lot of insights to different groups. 



Work-life Balance: I have never had an instance where I've had to work more than 40 hours in a week, and management is very flexible if you need to take time off during the day as long as you're getting your work done. Planning vacation is never an issue, management would never say you can't take a vacation or anything like that.","Doesn't Recommend,Positive Outlook,Approves of CEO",3.0,I have been working at Anonymous Investments full-time for more than a year,2.0,1.0,"Current Employee - Associate, Emerging Leader Program",5.0,"September 17, 2019"

Gives too much VTO and doesn’t anticipate proper staffing to help cover 2nd shift at night. 
Pressures employees to do the impossible and demands perfection yet pays crap, and doesn’t even listen to their employees.
PTO can only be planned. They get angry if you have to take sick days. 
They don’t actually give credit to outstanding employees like they should. I was supposed to get a VOC award but the manager who took it never submitted it even after multiple requests. 
They refuse to change your schedule.
The company says they’re family friendly but they really aren’t. 
They force you to sign a sort of gag order which means you’re not allowed to tell incoming employees or potential employees how bad it is while you work there up to a year after you leave.

They expect you to do all of these ridiculous things during a call, jump through hoops in a quick and timely manner however also need to be able to connect with callers while being verbally abused. 
The work environment is a little toxic. Feels like high school. If you’re not in someone’s click then you’re alone. If you’re pregnant they do give you a generous maternity leave however they are prejudice against you if you’re pregnant or become so. I had to constantly get up and go to the bathroom and had severe vertigo, because of that I wasn’t taking calls which caused my stats to go down. I was constantly pulled aside and “coached”, a polite way of reprimanding, and told that I, a pregnant woman, needed to hold it till my breaks. When I called HR about it I was told other pregnant women were held to the same standards, yet my own sister in law was almost fired because of the same issues. Every pregnant woman I’ve known who worked this position quit because of the discrimination. Doing a lawsuit against the company would be pointless because they can just say I wasn’t adhering to my required stats and NH is an at will state.
Word to the wise, don’t plan on starting a family while working on the floor. They will use every excuse under the sun as to why you can’t transfer departments or grow in the company and why you can’t get a different shift. I was 1:30-9:30pm. After I got pregnant I needed to change my schedule because I couldn’t drive at night. But again I was denied.

Time off: Anonymous starts at 18 days of paid time off per year.  After two years, it is bumped to 23. I love this. It's higher than what a lot of companies offer people with years of experience - at Anonymous it is standard. The negative, however, is that this PTO encompasses all personal time - you don't get any sick/personal/voluntary time off in addition to your PTO. (Excluding federal requirements, maternity, etc.)

Benefits: Anonymous will pay up to $10k in student loan debt over the course of 5 years ($2k a year, or $167 a month.) They'll also reimburse you (you pay up front) 90% of college tuition/coursework costs, up to $10k a year. I am taking advantage of both these programs.

Advancement: Anonymous is not a meritocracy and you cannot move up just by doing your job well and going home at 5.

In addition, I've never met anyone that won't tell you what their job is or how they got there.

570,"* Low pay. Anonymous's attractiveness comes from their retirement package but, at the end of the day, the base salary is comparatively low and it does NOT make up for the profit sharing or the additional 4% 401(k) matching contributions. I've been testing the market for a while and found out that I could easily be making 15-20% more (base salary) anywhere else. If you're considering getting a job here, be careful with the trade off because FI does NOT like, and rarely gives out, salary increases.



* Affirmative Action central. Whether you like it or not, there's a surplus of testosterone among Wall Street management levels. It's no secret. So FI has embarked in a program to even things out, which means that most of the people getting promoted as of lately are females and/or minorities. 



* Shady stuff going on. I've seen things that are outright a-legal. I can't say it was illegal because I was not privy to the final product but, having taken countless compliance classes (which you are required to take on an annual basis,) that we are exposed to this BS in such a in-your-face manner is really irritating.



* Management has ZERO people skills. There's a manager in our department that is well known to NOT like to work with other men (everybody knows this,) and he has zero men working with him. Instead of this raising a red flag, it is tolerated an even joked about as if it were... normal. In addition, when hired, I was told that the manager was looking for people to speak up in meetings... only to find out that they seems to promote the polar opposite. This seems to be ""The Norm"" at Anonymous: Say one thing, do another. There's... I don't know how to describe it... just a ""shady"" feel to the way they do business. I wouldn't be surprised if FI is in the news one day for having broken some kind of SEC rule soon. Case and point: A colleague of mine recently quit the company. His manager set up an exit interview to find out what the reasons for his departure were. They were in the conference room for 45 minutes and, according to my colleague, the manager did 95% of the talking. This is the kind of craziness you will be dealing with if you join FI.",1.0,"Jersey City, NJ","""Bad place to start your career or to grow""",1.0,"The only good thing about Anonymous are the benefits, which is why it is known in the industry as ""Social Security Central"" in the industry (lots of benefit-seeking, technology-averse folks who are happy to show up every day and pass/push paper around ).

571,"Honestly there are a lot of cons. I'll start with pay. The pay is definitely below market value. It's a hot economy and Anonymous openly admits that it pays less because the compensation is weighed more towards benefits. The problem is the benefits here aren't all that great. For example it takes 5 years to get vested in your 401k and a year before you are eligible for any match from the company. This may have been more impressive a few years ago, but many companies will vest you day 1 or within the first year of employment along with a match. 



Career advancement is slim to none for new associates. They have a career center on campus to help provide options for career growth, but the positions just aren't very attractive (phone work and processing work for various business units) and the level of effort to get those jobs is the same as just applying and interviewing for an outside role. There are too many hoops to jump through to move up within the company and honestly most people are in entry level roles for years before they move onto something else. Do you want to guarantee that you make entry level pay for years in this economy?



The biggest con is definitely the work itself. I worked in a phone role in PI and it was without a doubt the worst professional experience I've ever had. Imagine having to describe something you hated day in and day out with a character limit. This is my dilemma. 



The job is ultimately a burnout job. You take 50-60 calls a day while processing requests in customer's accounts. There are numerous challenges whether it is explaining complex trading strategies to people, helping an 80 year old log into Anonymous.com and locating documents, telling a customer you cannot recommend specific stocks to them, calming down an angry customer cussing at you. It goes on and on. This isn't to mention challenges related to technology or hold times within departments. You're getting hit from all sides and will disappoint a lot of customers with Anonymous's policies (and lack of exceptions). The worst part of this job is knowing you did it and didn't build any meaningful experience to add to your resume. You never get to think for yourself or lead any sort of project since you're always on the assembly line.

682,"Low base salary and total compensation for new graduates. If you don't plan on staying at Anonymous for at least 5 years, your total compensation would be better if you moved around companies or started your career at a different company.



Average software engineers. There are a few software engineers that perform above and beyond. There are several that plan to do the bare minimum and collect a paycheck. The technical interviews were not very hard, and the ability of the software engineers reflects this. This is not a great place for top (new grad) software engineers. It takes too much time (5 years) for the total compensation to be worth it.



Risk of disliking the business unit you are placed in after the Leap program. You don't get to talk directly with your after-placement manager, your Leap manager will place you after getting to know your interests and personality. I feel like 1 in 3 Leap graduates are not satisfied with their role after placement. With some bad luck, you can be placed in a business unit that offers no growth in useful technologies, no learning opportunities, and no help from senior engineers (my experience). Or with some good luck, you could be using the newest technologies with good mentors, and learning a lot. In general, they expect you to stay at least a year in your current business unit before moving, but you can tell within 6 months whether or not if the business unit and its progress are good enough for you. It is a huge gamble to enter the Leap program, knowing there is a decent chance the business unit you will be placed in will not be that worthwhile. It's up to you if you want to roll the dice. 



Emphasis on company loyalty. They tell you to focus on the ""product knowledge"",  which is useful to you only as long as you are working for Anonymous, but it's not great if you plan to leave Anonymous at any time in your life. They entice you with a total compensation that increases exponentially from 0 to 5 years. This means a below average total comp at 0 years and an above average total comp after 5 years. Many are promoted based on years of service. Even if you perform twice as well, you will not be promoted twice as quickly - it would be better for you to just switch jobs.



Slow moving technology. The company is slowly moving towards agile, cloud, and other new technologies, but change is extremely slow for financial companies. This means you might not be developing skills that are useful in your career the moment you leave Anonymous. Anonymous claims to be a technology company that specializes in finance, but improvements in technology are often hindered by business desires, such as excessive spending on contractors, and not enough spending on code refactoring and architecture improvements.

I've been searching the corporate hierarchy for years, while I don't have time to cycle through all 30-40K employees to try and find one that looks like me, it also shouldn't be that difficult if the company is truly as diverse as it thinks it is.

I realize advancement is based on merit, but as previously stated merit is not the determining factor, it's who you know or your demographics in the vast majority of decisions.

-They don't really tell you in the interview that it's just a call center.

-What they expect you to know and the quality of work they expect does not match the pay.

-Very very corporate! Management cares about you as a worker- not a person. They only care about you as long as it affects them.

-Even when you pass the series 7 & series 66, you only make 6-8 thousand more- which puts you at $44k-$46k.

-When you first start here, you have to work 12-8:30pm. This isn't a huge deal except for the fact that they make all the newer people work noon-8:30 but everyone else goes home at 5pm leaving you with not much support.

-You must have diabetes or low blood pressure to switch your lunch. 

-They don't hire for upper positions outside of the company. This is a pro and a con.

Management will coach you to take more calls than breaths you take. They present all of this in a way that sounds advantageous to you, but in reality it is just another corporation out to make the most money for themselves, and risk the sanity of their employees for that. 

The expectations change almost weekly. It's impossible to keep up with them.

Management will make you feel like you suck at your job before acknowledging that the things they request are unrealistic. AKA taking 8-10 calls per hour just to get a little above the bare minimum on the bonus scale.

""Coaching"" is not really coaching. They aren't ""helping you grow"" they are basically reading from the most generic customer service model.

1194,"1) Long-Term Compensation

While the initial package can be competitive the generosity will deplete very rapidly over time.  Even in a good year strong performers were lucky to get a yearly raise over 2-2.5%.  Raises for promotions, at least from TB to a principal/lead level, were an embarrassing 5% plus the potential for an extra 5% to the bonus.  HR and leadership would constantly try to use bonuses as an excuse for low salaries by claiming that it could help hard workers make up for the difference in their declining salaries but due to fine print the bonuses rarely met the advertised amounts.  For example, a TB qualifies for ""up to"" a 15% bonus.  However, bonuses are paid from a special budget that typically gets funded 80-90% in a good year.  Bonuses are also based on performance and even a strong performer would typically get 80-90% approved while an average performer could get 50% or less.  This math means that even during a particularly strong year for the company  a top performer is likely to see their 15% bonus come in at around 8-10%.  In spite of all the articles Anonymous posts about how to convince one's boss to increase one's wages there is zero room for compromise here.  The typical excuse from management is that if they adjusted someone's salary it would only make that person happy for a few years before that person would fall behind the market and complain again so management is better off leaving people where they're at.  Meanwhile salaries are regularly adjusted for Leap hires leading to TAs and TBs making more than many TCs and TDs.  To put the compensation gap into further perspective, many top performers were making more than 20% under market value after 2-4 years at Anonymous.



2) Low Technical Innovation

Technology here tends to lag behind true tech companies by 5-10 years and most of the higher level staff don't keep up with the times which means that even when new tech is pushed it is usually done without proper planning or understanding.  QA has yet to adopt an effective strategy for automation, they are still primarily using expensive licensed products instead of moving towards open-source, and the majority of the QA staff has little to no practical experience with automation or development.  Dev only cares about pushing out as much new stuff as possible with no regard for design or long-term quality as shown by the complete lack of unit tests or acceptance criteria.  Focus areas that would seem to be up-to-date fall short.  The mobile apps for example have consistently scored ratings that are average at best and are prone to performance issues, bad design choices, and bugs.  Most of the projects claim to be agile but every single agile project that I worked on was just a waterfall project with agile terminology mixed in.  It was common to see 6-12+ month projects that claimed to be agile even though every proposed feature was committed to by management on day one with no input from the team.  Even with hot technologies like blockchain and cryptocurrencies Anonymous pretends to be paying close attention while remaining willfully blind behind the scenes.  This lack of innovation and understanding can have an impact on engineers besides making the projects boring or frustrating.  If you aren't making a personal effort on your own time to keep your skills sharp and instead rely on your job to provide this exposure then you will quickly find yourself falling far behind the market.



3) Leap

Leap is a program used to recruit college graduates.  Every single year hundreds of new, largely inexperienced TAs from across the nation are hired and put through one of the various tracks, software development for example, for six months in the Leap program before being placed in an organization.  The first two months are classroom training and the latter four are spent on a project.  Unfortunately Leap's training does nothing to prepare these associates for their career.  The classes are too generic and broad and instead of using in-house staff to help provide mentoring the Leap management hires external contractors with no experience in the company and sometimes little experience in the field.  Even in the rare cases that internal management or company representatives did lead a particular class session their talk was focused more on random Anonymous information like the makeup of the executive team or pictures of the various campuses instead of useful material for the particular track.  The projects meanwhile are throwaways that rarely serve any purpose beyond keeping the Leap participants busy.  The problems don't end with Leap graduation either.  Hundreds of TAs are being brought in yearly but the company will rarely need hundreds of new TBs or TCs each year and TD roles are incredibly rare so the result is that many engineers find little room to grow once they are placed in their organization.  The company refuses to release official numbers but the general consensus is that turnover among Leap grads within their first two years of placement is abysmal.



4) Politics

The only way you could find a more political workplace is if you went to work for Congress.  A strong performer would generally still get raises and could potentially work their way up to a TC level but for the most part recognition and job security were more about cozying up to leadership than going above and beyond in your job.  Talented engineers were constantly leaving because they were being passed over for promotions or opportunities in favor of poor talent that played into the politics.  The best example of politics would be the yearly review process.  Like most companies Anonymous forces employees to fill out a self-evaluation each year then go through an end-of-year review with their manager.  However, unlike most companies Anonymous uses a process called common judgement.  Months before employees can even fill out the evaluations all of the leadership, managers and above, go off for a few days to collectively decide the rankings and rewards for everyone.  As you can imagine this turns into more of a popularity contest.  If employee A did great work while employee B was average at best but B kissed the feet of more people in the room then B was likely to get a better review than A.  Ratings are also based on ridiculous factors like the time you've spent in your current position or whether the final results resembled a bell curve distribution.  Someone may be a strong performer but if the bell curve is skewing left or they haven't been in the role as long as others, even lower performers, they'll likely get an average rating.  It also means that the entire process of filling out self-evaluations is a farce.



5) Career Growth

Many of the employees at a TD level or above are lifers regardless of any value they may or may not add in their role.  Between this, politics, and the massive influx of TAs from Leap there is a bottleneck around the TC level.  Most associate engineers can get promoted to a TB level eventually but to get to a TC level is a mix of a waiting game and politics and to move above that is a matter of even more politics plus being lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.  Discussions with one'smanager on how to move up are met with excuses on top of excuses.  The most common claim is that an associate has to be performing at a given level for a certain undisclosed amount of time before being moved to said level which equates to strong employees doing work well above their pay grade without any reward for their efforts apart from an empty promise that if they keep it up eventually they may get promoted.  



6) Morale

While Anonymous likes to keep their inner workings private the fact is that they've been systematically laying off thousands of employees over the past two years.  One event back in the summer of last year in which hundreds of people were let go just a month after thousands of other employees voluntarily left managed to leak out to the media and made the news.  In another recent round 100% of leadership in a personal investments organization was forced to reapply for their jobs, 75% were kicked out, and the remaining 25% that got through didn't even receive a pay bump for being rehired.  The expectations for each department are not decreasing, if anything they're increasing, so those who survive a layoff are left with significantly more work to do.  Meanwhile, in spite of record profits continuing to pad the pockets of the millionaires and billionaires running the company the yearly raises and promotions for regular engineers have remained static.  Work/life balance has become a pipe dream.  If you keep your head down, only do the work assigned to you without signing up for anything else, and only perform at an average level you may manage a reasonable work/life balance but strong performers are increasingly expected to pick up any slack in their departments and do more without any reward in return.  It was common to see 1-2 engineers doing well over 75% of the work for their team while putting in nights, weekends, and holidays or vacation days.  Many strong engineers considered it a light week if they only had to do 60 hours.  Allocation was irrelevant.  You could be assigned 100% to one project but you would still expect you to take up additional project work under the table, usually under some false pretenses of being a volunteer activity in which you were forced to participate.  This was made even worse by the overload of meetings that many teams engaged in.  It was common for project members to spend 40-60% of their week in meetings, the vast majority of which added no value, but management would not consider the meetings when planning the project timeline so engineers would still have a full load of tasks to perform on top of the meetings.  Some managers engaged in morally questionable activities like cheating hourly employees out of overtime or trying to cheat former employees out of earned PTO days.  Also, a quick search online will review numerous lawsuits that have been filed against the company in recent years by current or former employees.  If you complain to HR they will either tell you that they aren't concerned with your thoughts or they'll leak information back to your manager and you'll be punished for ""unrelated reasons"".  Needless to say, when combined with the other issues already listed above it's no surprise that morale here was sorely lacking. 



7) Leadership

Every single issue listed here and more all point to one major problem - leadership.  To say that leadership in my organization operated like a ""good old boys club"" would be an understatement and their ignorance was matched only by their arrogance.  QA leadership was the worst but dev wasn't far behind.  Across the board there is a lack of even basic knowledge regarding quality assurance, software development, or general industry trends and zero attempts are made to improve.  You could count on one hand the number of TDs and above in QA who could write ""Hello World"" or even a decent manual test case and still have unused fingers.  Many so-called leaders would even argue that it wasn't their job to know or understand such things.  Since leadership has no idea what they are doing with regards to technology much of the work that principal/lead engineers and managers should perform, including testing strategies or resource needs, is being pushed off to junior engineers who are better equipped for the task.  However, while leadership does nothing to support these lower-level engineers leadership would still take credit for successful deliveries or, if a release went poorly,  throw the junior staff under the bus.  This brings up the issue with leadership having no idea how to handle modern engineers or how to run a modern tech department.  The general mindset is reminiscent of an 80s approach.  For example, at a departmental all-hands meeting last fall, the only such meeting all year, senior leadership in the department acknowledged the drastic turnover among TA-TC engineers but then proceeded to rant about those ""darn millennials"" expecting gifts just for doing their work and how these young people should be ""grateful they have a job"".  Never mind that these TA-TC engineers are keeping the department afloat while being ripped off in every feasible way and openly insulted.  The general attitude from TDs on up was that they were above the common rabble.  They'll steal a lower level engineer's ideas because they have none of their own but still insist that because they outrank that engineer on paper they are somehow more intelligent.  In an effort to pad the budgets and feign importance it was common to see an overabundance of leaders in project teams.  There were assignments with one lead or manager for every 1-2 engineers even as the engineers did the work the leads and managers should have been doing.  Budget for employee expenses has been reduced to practically nothing.  Those below a TD level rarely get to travel, the laptops and other hardware are painfully dated, even small recognition awards like $20 gift cards have been cut, and there are frequent cases of managers forcing their employees to attend team lunches while making each team member foot their own bill.  Meanwhile management can afford catering for their ""leadership building"" events, it is common to see senior leadership traveling 1-2 times a month just to check in on their teams, and many senior leaders have brand new equipment even though they are least in need of such devices.  Leadership will ask for feedback but if you do anything other than sing their praises they will complain to your that you aren't a team player or, chew you out in your next 1:1, or give you a bad performance rating.  Attempts by previous leadership from years past to at least pretend that they cared about the opinions of those beneath them, an anonymous online suggestion box or anonymous yearly surveys for example, have been shut down under the reign of the current leadership team because according to them it wasn't conductive to their goals.  The executive team makes no effort whatsoever to reach out to the TA-TC engineers and turns a blind eye to everything going on beneath them so long as the leadership teams reporting to them bows down and claims everything is fine.  The executive team also makes poor decisions without doing proper research or math on the consequences.  For example, right before the layoffs last summer many of the older staff members in the company were ""offered"" a buyout.  The executive team grossly underestimated the number of individuals that would take the buyout, by almost 50% according to most sources, which means that a lot of teams lost a lot of experience and talent which in turn reduced the productivity of those teams greatly.  Perhaps the best recent example of leadership here is to point to a particular team that was once a gem for technology in the company.  Under the expert guidance of an externally-hired leader the team was able to blaze the initial trail for modern day testing in the company.  A few years ago though the executive team decided to force the leader overseeing the team to a new department and bring in a longtime company veteran as a replacement.  Under the awful reign of this new individual within 18 months over 2/3 of the staff on the team had left the company, multiple HR complaints had been filed against the new leader, and the team had become a shell of it's former self.  Thanks to the ""good old boys"" mentality though this leader hasn't even received a slap on the wrist and they along with their other leadership buddies will openly criticize every person that left the team claiming that those who left couldn't see the big picture, didn't understand how things work at Anonymous, or were overrated and couldn't actually do their jobs.  This is in spite of the facts that the team has gone from superstar status to an unproductive, floundering mess and the department hasn't seen a major technological breakthrough in years.",2.0,"Durham, NC","""Not for strong performers looking for a long-term stay""",1.0,"There are two details worth noting before beginning my review.  First, every organization within Anonymous is siloed from the rest and even within an organization different departments can be run in a very different manner.  As such the experience can be wildly different depending on where you land.  Glassdoor will not let me post the name of my particular organization so all I can say is that we focused on workplace investing and I was a QA in the tech department.  My review is based on my placement.  Second, different levels within tech are ranked based on letter designations.  A TA is an entry-level engineer, TB is an engineer, and TC is a senior engineer.  TD is either a principal/lead engineer or a manager and every letter higher is a leadership position. 



1) Benefits and Initial Compensation

For those hired outside the company, the initial salary will typically fall around the market average plus any position at a TB level or above qualifies for a bonus.  The benefits are also very competitive.  The retirement package is practically unbeatable with a 7% match and 10% profit sharing contribution each year.  Health insurance rates were constantly creeping higher but were still reasonable and coverage was strong.  PTO was very generous for salaried employees.  There literally aren't enough desks for the employees so most people are allowed to work from home at least a few days a week.  There are also a handful of minor perks that you can enjoy like a small reimbursement for the purchase of fitness equipment or extra payments made towards existing student loans, up to $2000 a year for five years.



2) Campus

The main Durham campus has been extensively renovated over the years and for the most part is very nice.  Every floor follows the open-office concept which makes for a loud and exposed experience at a desk and the conference rooms have glass walls so privacy for meetings is sorely lacking.  Also, the stairways and back hallways have not been renovated and tend to smell like mouse traps thanks to a constant rodent problem.  However, the main spaces are well-lit and nicely decorated, desks are generally well-equipped, the front entrance makes a good first impression, parking is plentiful, the outdoor walking paths allow a chance for some fresh air, and there are certain on-site amenities that employees can use like a health clinic, tech support bar, cafeteria, and small gym.  Bear in mind that the latter two are not particularly cheap or well-equipped and are more for convenience than a cost-saving measure for employees.



3) The Employees

In the years that I worked here I met some wonderful people at the TA-TC level and a few at the TD level.  Even though I have left the company I still make an effort to stay in touch with these individuals and am glad to call them friends.","Doesn't Recommend,Neutral Outlook,No opinion of CEO",2.0,I worked at Anonymous Investments full-time for more than 8 years,2.0,3.0,Former Employee - Senior Quality Assurance Engineer,2.0,"January 19, 2018"

1206,"-First of all, it is a call center job.  The title makes it sound fancier and in the interview they might make you think you are going to be doing a lot more things related to investments than you actually will.  Probably 80% of calls are password resets and simple financial transactions.

-Benefits are good as a percentage, but my base salary was so much lower than what I made after I left that 7%  401k match AND 10% profit sharing was less than 4.5% 401k match at my current company.  There are a lot of benefits that most people don't use that they use to justify how great the benefits are.  Like adoption assistance, tuition reimbursement, college loan assistance.  Just do the math with what you will use and how much you'll get with your salary.  Remember that your base salary grows exponentially with raises and your benefits grow based on that.  Lower base salary now = even lower base salary in 10 years.

-They say they pay for the CFA; they don't.  They specifically told me in the interview that they pay for CFA prep classes.  It also says that in the tuition reimbursement documentation.  There is one stipulation though.  It only qualifies if you take the class from an accredited university.  I don't know of any official universities that offer specific CFA review classes (you take the review classes to prepare for the test, not to get college credit).  I had a friend who took Kaplan review classes and then fought with them for months for the reimbursement and ended up just giving up.  I took and passed two CFA tests while there without a penny going towards the classes.  I don't know if they are intentially tricking people or if nobody knows enought about the CFA to know that the stipulation the put on it makes it null.

-The job itself is miserable.  So many metrics that you have to hit, fielding literally thousands or random questions and complaints.  Constant coaching (telling you what you do wrong).  One time I got ""feedback"" for saying ""no problem"" because ""problem"" is a negative word.  There were days when I would get up, take a shower, get dressed and then call in and go back to sleep because I just couldn't bring myself to go back there again. Some people were ok with it though.

1229,"- no mobility especially if you are already in a specialized area.  They talk about moving people up or across all the time, but in reality, it doesn't happen.  

- favoritism.  (Yes, it exists everywhere and that includes Anonymous.)  What's hard to stomach is knowing the person getting preferential treatment is a horrible worker while those who do a great job can be given a hard time.

- abuse of overtime.  It's hard to believe that management wouldn't be aware but it seems to be a common issue that is not addressed.  Those working needless hours would get a higher payout on bonuses as well based on hours worked per year.  Essentially they are being rewarded twice for ""stealing"" from the company.

- the bonus payout really stems from management's opinion of you.  Even being a high performer on the team does not guarantee a fair rate.  In all truth, it's impossible to understand how they derive at their numbers.

- my managers have either been disengaged or came from departments where they had little to no working knowledge for our group.  It's very hard working for someone that lacks basic knowledge of what your work entails.

- they advertise a lot about woman empowerment, but I haven't witnessed it in my group.  I would venture to say it might be the exact opposite.  If you are talented, you are more likely to be seen as a threat and this will be reflected in how you are treated and the type of compensation you receive.

- the ""fit"" meal program is kind of a joke.  When I started with the company, I thought it was a fantastic idea, but ""fit"", as far as my coworkers and I can tell, is based solely on sodium intake.

- decent bonuses

- longevity of the employees.  This is both a good and bad thing.  It is good because it gives a strong sense of loyalty to the company and knowledge stays within the firm.

1416,"Beyond training you to pass the series 7 and series 63, Anonymous doesn’t really train you for the job you will be performing. 

Most, if not all jobs, are customer facing phone center jobs. Half your time will be spent dealing with angry customers. Most of the time they were told the wrong way to transfer money, or otherwise service their account, by a poorly trained rep. Other times, a form will be rejected and instead of Anonymous sending an email or making a call, a poorly worded letter will be sent advising the customer to call the general service line instead of the back office group that can actually help with the problem. 

Prepare to be micromanaged. In an eight hour shift, you will get one paid 30 minute break and one unpaid 30 minute lunch. Other than that, you are expected to be on the phone. You will receive “coaching” from your manager if you spend too much time writing notes on an account, if you don’t enroll enough people in the voice recognition system, if you call the help desk too much because you don’t know how to help the customer, if your calls are longer than ten minutes, if you don’t take at least 6.5 calls in an hour, or if you don’t get enough new business leads. Also, your job performance will be judged based on what customers think of you. Customer surveys must be “top box” for them to count toward your bonus.  If you help a customer who was given bad information by a previous rep, even if you resolve the issue, if they’re still unhappy with the overall service Anonymous gave them (which they usually are), you get a poor evaluation. That poor evaluation is then used to assess how much of a bonus you get.

After passing the series 7 and 63 you get a retention bonus. Meaning, if you work at Anonymous for less than a year after receiving the bonus, you have to pay it back. This was put into place because of the huge amount of turnover that takes place once reps are done with the training and start the actual job.

From a salary perspective Anonymous is way behind technology companies. I left a senior position in Anonymous, and joined a junior position in a technology company. My salary went from $74,800 to $120,000. 



Once you get to senior in Anonymous, the path to principal, manager, director and above is almost non-existant these days. Your promotion path is not based on job performance, it is based on putting the time in with the group you're with. This much was admitted to me in my review meetings. If you join as a senior or get promoted to senior and want to be promoted to principal be prepared to put in more than 5 years before even being considered for it, and chances are the company will use a down turn in the economy as a reason for not giving you the promotion you deserve.



If you're near retirement you'll be fired so the company can save money by not giving you a full retirement package. I know a lot of people that this happened to in 2008, and again recently. 



The company keeps changing direction. When I joined in 2007 teams were organized by function - developers, testers, etc. Recently they re-organized by product. You can be sure in another 6 - 8 years they'll go back to being organized by function after an independent consultant comes in and makes the case for it.

-management is all about the flavor of the day: for a couple of months it was having great conversations with clients, then it was all about having a good workplace to be in.. now it's about taking as many calls as humanely possible with no rest. 
-management likes to hype up the small things.. like wireless headsets, or taking a break when you want to... but they will pass a long all bad news to the lower level managers and will not face the front line reps at all. They refuse to hear any criticism on policy updates. Some are so far removed from helping any client that it's comical what they expect.
- lately they have been devaluing the high net worth service reps. They used to allow for casework and follow up on issues, but they've tossed that in favor of handling as many clients as possible. So now the client with 2 mill as equal standing as client with 2k. 
-management treats all reps the same, no matter fresh out the dorm room or seasoned worker. Can be frustrating..

1786,"I originally found this job posting when searching for Hospitality related jobs. Hospitality professionals, BEWARE. They are going to tell you that you don't need a finance background and that they can teach you everything you need to know. This is not all together true. They are going to train you the absolute minimum that they can, and then they throw you onto the phones. 



This is not a customer service position. It's sales. Most of the calls are awful, and people pretty much yell at you all day for things that are completely out of your control.  Need help? Call your help desk that's most likely to belittle you and make you feel like an idiot. It's bad enough that customer's are rude, but any other department you call for guidance is rude too. 



Have a bad day? Well, everyone is going to know about it. They send out a stack rank email every day with your calls handled, hold time, after call work time and survey score to your entire time. Oh, the survey score scale rating goes like this: Highest score = 100%, and not the highest score = 0%. Seems fair right? Even better, they ask three questions, one of them being satisfaction with rep, and it doesn't even count. The only one you get scored on is the one that asks about their overall experience. 



I understand that this job is just not for some people, as I found out pretty quickly. I was told that advancement could happen quickly, however the path to an off-phone role can take years. This is why so many people seem jaded when I was in training, but I didn't see the red flags quick enough. 



Also, you get a 30 minute break and a 30 minute lunch for an eight hour shift. You have to use your break time to go to the bathroom so it doesn't eat up your after call work and effect your metrics. You pretty much feel like a kindergarten that's being monitored consistently.",2.0,,"""Customer Relationship Advocate""",2.0,"Benefits package

All the other groups in my business function received pay raises, and 3 or 4 other functions in the company did the same job as my group, and they got paid 20-50% more. The only time I felt like anyone cared that I was working my tail off was when I announced that I was quitting.

Overworked - you are tethered to your phone, and you are required to take inbound calls constantly. It is a call center.

""Sales"" - you are consistently told that you are in a sales function, you have a quota to hit, and you are held to metrics. However, you have no control over what phone calls you take or what customers you talk to, and the environment and pay are not reflective of a sales function.

Pay - the pay was pathetic compared to the rest of the industry/rest of the company.

Budget cuts - we were not allowed to work overtime, but our sales goals were raised.

Inconsistency - calls were transferred to my function by other sales roles. Those sales roles had very little idea what customers needed or wanted, and we were restricted from giving any type of pushback. We were required to take all calls that came to us, regardless of whether the customer's questions were in our job description.

Promoting based on politics - I saw multiple instances of people getting promoted that did not deserve the job. There was an explicit instance that I witnessed where someone was hired into a position because they were a woman, even though they were less qualified than another candidate (who happened to be male) - management made an explicit comment that they wanted to hire a woman to the position.",2.0,"Merrimack, NH","""Undervalued and Overworked""",1.0,"Great benefits.

If you took 1-2 finance classes in college you will probably learn nothing new to help you in the industry. The monitoring and problem solving skills learned are 100% based on troubleshooting of departmental chaotic/confused processes of using excel and/or internal softwares. 

Managers don't (mostly) have any managerial skills or passion to manage and do so in order to climb the latter. In reality, they are analysts who stayed at Anonymous the longest (or when everybody else left after 2-3 years). 

Those who leave (which is almost all employees except managers) do so after realizing they will never be able to support an adult life/family with the low pay (including all ""unique benefits""). 



In conclusion, 

To demonstrate the shortsightedness and focus on internal computer troubleshooting I will use this fact: Most managers and directors can tell you a lot about how to find a variance due to miscalculation of an Excel's spreadsheet formula but no very little to nothing about the stock market, bond market, and most importantly the nature of mutual fund investing.

2031,"This pertains specifically to the Denver site, but is also relevant to the role as a whole;





1) In the FR role you're essentially forced to burnout. The efficiency metrics are high, and when you good at the role you will take 70-100 calls a day. If you haven't done this before, you have no idea how exhausting it can be, people are pissy, impatient and dump their problems in your lap every day. Despite having a Series 7, you will quickly learn you're not really a stock broker, you're a frontline customer serviced rep in a call center. I rarely trade, most of my day is spent playing clean up with banking,tech support or paperwork issues while playing damage control with inconvenienced clients. You will quickly learn how insane people can be, you WILL have a client cussing and irrationally berating you because you can't make their check clear on a Sunday. 



2) The career opportunities are narrow, particularly for the Denver site. During training they will tell you that everyone is promoted within 4-5 months, and some promoted out of the training class. This is misleading at best. I'm a top performer in the site and now over a year in role, there are serious issues with favoritism in hiring, I've seen stellar candidates passed over countless times. Even with a promotion, it doesn't change the fact that 90% of jobs are on the phone. It's not easy to be leashed to a phone for 8 hours at a time, there are no projects, or tangible accomplishments, your tasks are often monotonous and dry.



3) There's a massive morale problem in the role, more than half the people I talk to are actively seeking other employment or are despondent and burnt out. If you don't drink the company Kool - Aide 100% (which you never should at any job) you will quickly see a lot of the problems with the business decisions, common practices and client t treatment are frustrating. With this being said, there are people who enjoy the job, and stay in it for years, just be very self aware when you consider the job. 



4) For the licenses, you're underpaid compared to the industry. They justify this by giving you a ""culture"" that is superior. To a degree it's accurate, compared to other phone sites and financial firms, it's pretty decent. 



5) Your central metric, upon which bonuses and promotions are centrally focused, are customer surveys, which are graded irrationally and unfairly. You can correlate higher, but it is largely random, and it can be infuriating.",2.0,"Denver, CO","""If you're looking at the Financial Rep Role, read this.""",2.0,"Decent benefits(which they've recently begun to cut back on).

Long tenured middle managers and individual contributors also show a strange indentured servitude behavior. Many don't have the spine to say the truth, stand up for their beliefs and do the right thing. The culture is to sugar coat bad news and push all decision making as far up as possible.

1 ~ If you end up in the wrong department with the wrong boss your life can be a living hell. Anonymous is very liberal in its HR policies which can be good but also means they let things fester for a long time before taking action. There is a percentage of people that will take advantage of this and especially if you are on a small team you may end up constantly covering for a weak link.



2 ~ It is an American dream to start in the mail room and work your way up to VP someday and that is totally possible at Anonymous. In fact, it may be a bit too easy. It is completely common to attend leadership meetings and hear from senior executives ""I started on the phones just like you!""  Well, that is fine once in a while but at some point you do want people leading you to actually have some training and experience. Anonymous is full of hundreds maybe thousands of Directors, VP's and SVP's that started on the phone ""just like you"" and it shows.



3 ~ Anonymous has managed to stay out of the news but there are plenty of unsavory things they do behind the scenes. They are currently very worried about the Department of Labor proposed Fiduciary Rule. Their current employer benefits business model is already unethical but if the rule is enacted will be illegal as well. It has long been a major IRA rollover sales lead source to take advantage of relationships with employers to gain access to employees. Anonymous is the world's largest 401k record-keeper and should this lead source be taken away it will be a huge hit to their personal investing sales model in which two thirds of the new assets are from internal rollovers.

2 ~ Upward mobility and job opportunities. I may be biased from working at the Westlake campus where there are over 6000 jobs but it is also relatively easy to move to other locations within the company. There was a time years ago when it might have felt like you had to go to Boston to move up in the company but those days are gone and there are many great leadership positions throughout the country.

When they downsized a few yrs back they laidoff some of the best most knowledgeable talent, i suspect bcuz they made the most money, but many left were clueless which meant that those remaining had to do twice as much and cover the clueless.

They give you a book of clients, there's no cold calling since they provide leads and you can make over 6 figures with average effort. But in reality it's a pure sales role with very little concern about what's right for the client. Definitely not a fiduciary advisor and the turnover is extremely high.  It's all about selling product and filling the buckets. Anonymous FCs are managed by the ever present spreadsheet. Everyone is stacked ranked and if you are below average on any category your branch manager or RPC ( who are usually inexperienced coaches that stink at sales) will come talk to you to see how to improve. The problem is there are like over 20 categories of things they measure you on. So you will always be below average in something! Another annoying thing is every click on the computer, every phone call, every email is tracked like big brother ! They also continually roll out some new method or spreadsheet and say this is the way things are going to be so get used to it. 4 months later you never hear about that spread sheet again. There is no adjustment if you are new, if you are in different markets or have a smaller or a more established book. There is a certain level of gamesmanship with the numbers too. Click here it counts, click here it doesn't even if you did the work. Talk to a client for like 30 seconds and tag their deposit and you get credit. Drop this client from your book without the client knowing and you won't get hit with an outflow.   The people who do well in the role game the system the best. All the managers are ok with this and all they care about is selling managed money, annuities and bringing in new assets. Who cares what's right for the clients. That's really the sad part the clients think you are helping but in reality you are just selling what pays you the most basis points and hope they never call you after the sale.

2692,"Customer service representative work and culture is truly toxic, mentally taxing, entirely sedentary, and unsettlingly monitored by management. You are physically chained to your desk by a phone set for nine hours a day, and provided with two 15-minute breaks and one 30-minute break, all of which are timed by the tracking system. 



There's a big sentiment of favoritism that guides promotions, bonuses, and on the flip side - verbal / written warnings. You don't need to be able to think in order to excel in this role, you just need to be able to follow chain of command and avoid questioning anything. Voicing your opinion will always work against you.



For anyone who studied finance / econ / business, be warned: this is NOT a finance job in any capacity. You will not learn anything about the financial service industry by being here - unless you move into a licensed role, in which you'll really only be able to learn about the industry to pitch the same handful of Anonymous products that benefit the company, so it's really just a glorified sales role. I work with many people who previously worked in grocery stores, coffee shops, or retail shops, who never went to college. It doesn't matter what you know - if anything, it'll benefit you to avoid all forms of thinking whatsoever, as Anonymous does not value ideas, only obedience. 



Your schedule is monitored by a system that quantifies every second you spend on / off the phone into performance metrics that determine your fate at the company. Do not drink too much water at your desk. If you take bathroom breaks, it'll harm your metrics and your manager will have to talk to you and possibly issue a warning. Management speaks like they ""want to help you"", but they really want to help themselves climb the Anonymous ladder, and couldn't care less about their expendable employee base. Pay is very low for a financial services industry job...customer service reps are barely making $38k. And this was after a much-raved about ""pay increase"" that we should've been so humbled and honored to receive, for the grueling work we struggle through. 



Coaching sessions are torturous. You'll be placed in a room with your manager and possibly two to three other colleagues, to listen to each others calls, and tear them apart to bits. You are expected to adhere to a call structure and parrot the same lines, check off a certain number of transfers to certain departments, pitch a certain number of ""contribution increases"" to bring more money to Anonymous at the customer's expense. Managers never tell you what you did well on calls, only what you did poorly. It's not that we don't want feedback and to improve - but sometimes, we did some really nice things on the calls and want to be recognized for our positives too.



Minor technicalities are a guaranteed pull down the rabbit hole of warnings. If you have a technical error, the quality team screens more of your calls, notifies your manager, and you get a ""verbal warning"". They'll screen exponentially more of your calls than they do for anyone else, so that they catch more mistakes you made that everyone else makes too - regardless of how minimal they may be, the repercussions escalate very quickly. Management gets excited to prosecute their employees and never looks at the full situation when quality provides feedback. Half the time, they don't even read their emails or listen to the call, just issue a warning because you ""messed up,"" and they don't care about your side of the story. Sometimes if you try to explain, they'll ask you to stop talking.



If you start in a phone center, you will end in a phone center. Before you begin working, management will pitch to you that the ""sky's the limit"" with career growth in the company, but they don't tell you about the red tape that stands between you and the sky. Anonymous sucks people in for years and years, until they don't have any speakable skills to pitch anywhere outside the company because they've been on the phones for so long, and they're stuck there. It's a culture run by unfair management who talks down to you like you're an incompetent toddler. You will be overworked, underpaid, and undervalued for all the efforts at self-betterment in this job, as it all goes to waste. If they like you, they like you. If they don't, nothing will change that. Either way, get out of there sooner rather than later.

Old fashioned attitudes

The downside to the training program is that the team that you get placed on is very hit or miss and very much or if your control. Some people were placed on awesome teams working with cool products and technologies while others were stuck working on software that was 20 years old. 

Also during the training there are a lot of B.S. corporate events/talks, which were super cheesy and unnecessary. Some of the topics during training were a waste of time too, like learning how to write an e-mail (yes, I'm serious).

The team I was placed on seemed to have no plan in place for me when I got there despite the fact that a manager has to request an associate from the aforementioned training program so it's not like I was placed on their team by surprise or without their knowledge.

The whole time I was there I wrote probably a total of 20 lines of code because the product was in maintenance and there was very little new development. There wasn't really any work for me to do, so I essentially got paid to read reddit all day.

This was my first job out of college as a software developer. They have a training program where they send you to North Carolina for five months to learn about various technologies and to work on a ""real life"" project.

About halfway through the program you get notified of the actual team that you'll be on when you return to your job site. You have some input with this, but the decision is ultimately made by management.

I can't pay rent, buy food, or pay all the other bills I have will my ""great benefits.""  Money is the only thing that helps with that - and the salaries Anonymous pays, compared to the broader industry, are ridiculously low.  Moreover, there have been numerous changes that have occurred in the last 12 months that are ostensibly to ""make things better"" for the customer, as well as the associate, but the net effect has been the opposite ... for both.  They've basically significantly increased the scope of the role, while narrowing the performance metrics ... all while creating an increasing environment where it essentially makes it impossible for you to provide the positive experience the customer is expecting, and meet your goals.  How this has played out out to associate is ... you can kiss making more than the bare minimum for your quarterly bonuses (which also ... in not very much at all) goodbye.  Also, over the last 12 months or so, there seems to have been a dramatic concern with turnover, primarily among the associates who have been with the company less than 12 months.  The company has become ridiculously preoccupied with finding ways to keep this demographic with the company that they're basically throwing everything but the kitchen sink at them in the misguided hope it will keep them from leaving.  Basically ... they're focusing all their measures on increasing salary, compensation, and quality at work to the employees who have been there the least, and contribute the least to the company's overall functionality.  I've been with the company, and in this function for years, and even though I've been given yearly bonuses and increases I sit next to people who have been licensed less than 6 months, and are making the same amount in salary as me, or more.  It's really insulting, not to mention makes all the experienced, and seasoned employees feel extremely unappreciated.  Then there's also the issue that performance and ability really have no bearing whatsoever towards promotions or recognition for achievement - the current situation at the location where I work reminds me more of my senior year of high school, and everything boils down to a popularity contest.  The end result is you have people who weren't even competent to begin with and routinely failed to meet even the most basic of their performance metrics, being given increased levels of responsibility and management if they're ""popular.""

Employees are reminded every day from the first time they peruse the careers website, to the job interview, to on-boarding, to training, to team meetings, that Anonymous isn't like Merrill Lynch, Schwab, JP Morgan, or any other player in the game; Anonymous is a family-owned company and doesn't have to play to it's shareholders, and thus they are one of the few in the business ""for the customer"". That sure sounds nice, but beyond being family-owned, it's just not true. This job is in a 24/7 call center, and just like every call center in the world, metrics are king. You'll never move up anywhere in the company for retaining a multi-million dollar account or preventing perilous actions through education of financial instruments or any other morally outstanding action... you'll move up for finishing your calls on an average of less than eight minutes. This ""time = money"" focus exacerbates an already-beaurocratic business structure by incentivizing representatives to transfer their calls or to be curt to the point of being entirely unhelpful. That's fine, and almost expected from most call center representatives with other companies, but in financial services, it's unacceptable; you're dealing with people's retirement accounts and livelihoods. On the sales side, recommendations are limited to proprietary target-date funds and bloated, high-fee ""managed"" accounts. Going above and beyond to solve problems that are repeatedly surfacing and are consistently unaddressed is a habit discouraged by management: ""that's not your job"". Other than their own propaganda, nothing differentiates this company from the other financial services firms--do not take a potential paycut to choose Anonymous over them with the idea that you'll be working for some sort of Red Cross organization, even though they will spin it that way.

If you weren't able to deduce, there is an unhealthy amount of turnover at Anonymous due to employees leaving for increased responsibilities and salaries (most Jax representatives went to Merrill, which was literally across the street!).

Generally speaking, upon completion of the program, financial representatives are capable of adequately performing the job duties in what is objectively a complicated job function without any sort of assistance. Also, barring a layoff climate or doing anything illegal, job security is very, very high; never hitting your numbers will still get you your weekly paycheck.

In reality, training is now so utterly warped and schizophrenic that you likely will need a promotion above the entry level position to assist with anything more complicated than cutting a check or trading a mutual fund. Consequently, it is absolutely crushing that you can't help half the customers that wait hours in line to get to you and that's even worse when you first start to where you transfer 95% of your calls. Management is unhelpful and most of the call center managers you honestly scratch your head at what they actually do other than go to meetings and give you self-directed coaching assignments. As with any call center, metrics are King. I got promoted entirely because I got through calls fast and didn't ask questions only for the next role to be even worse. Certain departments (core/hnw services mainly) have forced overtime right now that is held against you if you don't meet the supposed goal or have other activities that prevent you from doing so. The new systems internally have also taken hold times and raised them exponentially because of the new/barely trained reps having to transfer everything and attrition causes old reps to leave for jobs outside of fidelity or internal promotions with the stress the new system has lumped on them from new hires being functionally useless. Volumes aren't even as bad as they were last year but it's still a high stress job that keeps you tied to a cubicle having to apologize to clients for management failing to see the problem in changing the entire service model at the busy time of year when clients are already in a hurry and coming in in droves.

Poltiical maneuvering among senior leaders is widespread, a result of C-level unwillingness to set direction clearly or resolve conflicts decisively. Company culture is consensus-driven - often from the bottom up in that individuals, groups and teams are left to work things out themselves - and when issues among teams arise that cannot be resolved below the SVP level, they remain unaddressed and left to fester until things get bad enough that someone senior HAS to step in, usually with more fallout than would have been necessary if the problem had been addressed earlier.

The systems provided need a MAJOR overhaul.  There are procedural specific systems and client specific systems to use when handling calls.  These systems are not updated, so 1/2 the time you are under a constant worry if you are handling something incorrectly.  When cross trained on multiple products, you are not trained completely, so customers can ask questions you are supposed to be able to answer, but you can't because you don't know.  The answer is supposed to be searchable while you put the customer on hold to get the answer.  But holds can only be for 3 minutes, and it can take a lot longer than 3 minutes to find the answer because 1/2 the time when you search something the system comes back with no results. 



If a customer escalates, they don't go to your immediate manager, you're to call your ""solutions desk and escalate the call"" and that rep is supposed to handle the call from that point.  However the solutions desk reps are extremely lazy and will do anything and everything to push the call back on the tier 1 rep because they don't want to handle the call, thus causing the customers to become completely frustrated, yelling and screaming at us over why we are not transferring them to a supervisor, and then give us a bad customer survey.



If you need to enter a work item, they are shipped off shore to some reps in India to handle who have no idea what they are doing.  So they resolve the work item incorrectly, and we need to enter multiple work items for the same exact thing over and over.  We promise customers a 5 day work around timeframe and something so simple can take over 1 mo to resolve because the India reps just don't care.   The customers become very upset over how long it takes to resolve a simple error. 



While the company offers great potential for advancement, it is all in who you know, not what you know.  I had an interview for an internal transfer once, and while I was nervous as I didn't have a lot of interview experience at the time, my interviewer was constantly yawning and looking at his phone even before the interview started.  I don't think I was that boring, but that was extremely unprofessional and I can't believe he got the job he did because while I didn't get it, once trained I'm sure I would've been way more suited for the position. 



When you do need your manager and not a ""solutions desk rep"" they are nowhere to be found because they are always ""in a meeting"".  



This job creates a lot of extremely stressful situations, but when you become frustrated and voice your opinion, you're in the wrong and put under review or fired.  You can offer suggestions on how you think things should be and how to correct it, and management will pat you on the back for it, but then nothing is ever done to fix anything.",2.0,"Morrisville, NC","""What you need to succeed - NOT""",2.0,"Competitive Pay

3547,"This particular position is a dead end, but management may lead you to believe your responsibility will improve or that you are doing work that is important.  The work is simply making charts and analyzing numbers in Excel, which others will use to make decisions and this gets boring quickly.  The people you will work for can be high strung and passive aggressive, so they will ask you to do something and then hover over you until it is done, or they will be short with you and then friendly later on to make up for their initial rudeness.  Few of them have the time to teach you, so be prepared to learn on your own.  The corporate culture is poor because the main hires are highly intellectual people from top universities who typically have limited social ability.  People in my department went through the day with little social interaction and when they did interact it was forced and awkward.  The managers are better socially, but they don't know how to lead people because their prior roles were individualistic assignments.  Those assignments didn't allow for the opportunity to hone people management or leadership skills.  Instead of rolling up their sleeves and making the occasional tough call, managers sometimes pay people lip service and kick the can down the road.  Management's personnel decisions come slowly or not at all for fear that those decisions won't work out and it will reflect poorly on them.  Upper level executives are slow to make any drastic or necessary operating and strategic decisions, which are required in this rapidly changing industry.

Metrics - It is understandable that a call center would have metrics, but even the best employees will miss them. They are arbitrary numbers that management places too much weight on.

3589,"I don't know about other call centers in the company - but in ours, they schedule overtime automatically into your schedule then you have to opt out by a specific time otherwise you're expected to work it. People on here keep calling the vacation time ""PTO"" but it's not truly. It's accrued vacation time, max of 4 weeks a year (depending on years of service), and it's use it or lose it (no carry over to next year). The NH call centers are ""triple AAA"" rated, meaning if there is a weather event or crisis in another center, we cover for them if they need to close, and if we have bad weather here - we're still open regardless. In the call center, you have to schedule your vacation time about a year in advance, but they do give you the option to change dates through the year. Vacation date availability is doled based on seniority in your ""gate,"" but to be honest, this is really the most fair way to do it. Just don't expect to have any big holidays off in your first couple of years there is what I'm saying. 



There's little upward mobility. They have a Management Apprenticeship Program, but the people I've seen go into it aren't those that work their tails off - it's those that buddy up to their manager. When you come out of the program, you might go right back to your old position, until a manager position opens up - eventually. Also, on this vein - I started the company working a late second shift, but needed to change to a first shift for personal reasons. My manager at the time was resistant to have me move - not because we were shorthanded on the 2nd shift - he said 1st shift was reserved for those who ""earned"" it, and that it was a ""reward."" Now there are times when people are actually HIRED for 1st shift, so how is that a reward for those who are just hired? Nor am I a lackluster employee. 



As a rep over 6 years, I've probably had 10+ managers - and my position hasn't changed. So it's very hard to know what is expected of you, and to truly succeed. With having so many managers, any goals that I've set with previous managers have gotten lost and I've had to start from the bottom. If you want something for yourself, such as a new position, you better work for it, and work fast. Also, don't ever get comfortable at your cubicle, you will move. Alot. 



If you ever take a Leave of Absence, expect that when you come back, that the call center may have been reorg'd and your position as you knew it when you left is no longer available, and the new position that is taking over may not be offered to you. 



There are no COLA raises. 



Finally, if you ever have a problem with a manager, the burden of proof is entirely on you to prove you are being mistreated somehow.

3666,"This company has an uncomfortably cult like environment. Everyone has to put on an air of completely loving Anonymous and loving their job like they are brainwashed robots; if you don't play along, you will have problems. If you want to reveal your true feelings about the job, or you have something remotely negative to say, think carefully about who to confide in. It's actually pretty vital to be over the top pro-Anonymous if you want any chance of transferring around or getting a promotion one day. However, plenty of people still don't get to move around or get the promotions that they deserve because they don't act brainwashed enough and/or they're so good that they are kept trapped in the call center forever. Some managers have all but lost their call center skills and they basically serve as cheerleader coaches. They might ""coach"" you on what to say, but rarely will get on the phone themselves and have lost touch with what the job entails.



In the call center you are micro-managed severely. Co-workers and managers will sit down with you and pick apart your calls word for word. You'll be invited to pick apart other calls as well. Every second on the job is recorded and timed. If your call extends into your lunch break or you have to take an extra bathroom break, you'll be out of adherence which you will be reprimanded for and which will affect your next bonus. Your bonus is completely up to your manager's discretion, by the way, which has quite a few implications. Your team will compete with other teams to have the best stats and you will receive judgment for yours, even though most of it seems nonsensical and/or out of your control.



Orientation frames the job as pretty great. You have a blast with your new co-workers and are spoiled with fun activities and long lunches. But once you are out on the floor and the novelty has worn off, you see the job is more about statistics than anything else. Customer service is heavily emphasized in conversation, yet all that really counts is call lengths, schedule adherence, how much your manager likes you, being fanatically pro-Anonymous, and being subjected to constant and excessive micro-managing and taking it all with a smile and nod. 



It's hard not to even have the support of your co-workers. The gossiping is incredible. For some, this place is really their life's career and they will never leave, so you must be careful about what you say about the company and you have to navigate the strange drama of people who have worked there for years. There are also so many people in the call center that you will regularly have other people's mistakes dumped on to you via a livid customer and/or will find that co-workers don't care to take a transfer or help you during a difficult call. Burnout here tends to make people curt and apathetic toward each other, which is no fun when you have a customer on the line and a manager who's constantly looking to find fault in your actions. I constantly felt stranded. 



I should mention that the job itself of answering calls is not easy. In short, there is an entire book behind every retirement plan. You have customers throwing all sorts of crazy and complex questions at you while you have to stall for time while browsing an extensive encyclopedia of information. You will find that your resources are incomplete, confusing, way too elaborate, and/or misleading on a regular basis, which renders a lot of stressful and difficult calls. Have I mentioned all the abuse you have to swallow from customers? They are way worse than customers face-to-face. Some days you feel like you are being attacked on all sides. 



Although everyone has to act like Anonymous is utterly amazing, give it enough time and you'll see what's really going on - the nonsensical promotions, people becoming trapped in the call center - denied every opportunity to take a new position, and unable to leave the company because they have no transferable skills - people's relief to get off the phones whenever allowed, the apathy, etc. it's depressing. It's the unhappiest work environment for a customer service job because you have to act completely fake all the time with everyone you work with and every single thing you say and do is watched and usually ripped apart by co-workers and managers. I had a lot of awful days on this job and was so happy to get ou.

Overall, poor support of all the main themes they advocate: work life balance, integrity, culture.   The process that managers are required to maintain a working relationship with their employees doesn't apply with upper management.  They put out fires and congregate only when corp executives are paying attention.  Huge inconsistencies in OT needs vs. life balance, actual job role vs. what you're responsible for, company processes vs. actual process.  



* A lot of managers confused, uncomfortable, and/or constantly feel their job is at risk.   



* The allowed leniency within each business unit makes for huge discrepancies. 



* A lot of complaints from employees and management that there's a clear disregard to promote people who are actually qualified.



* Compensation was below average locally and nationally across multiple roles.  Team that up with OT + added responsibilities + inconsistent processes + mixed communications and you get high stress for less than average.



** It has a lot of the typical political messes a job like this brings.  Advancement is possible, but, similar to most companies, you must be liked by the right people.  Compensation is comparable if you're one of the top 15% who are selected for one of their prestigious sales roles.

4050,"Test environments are horrible - It is impossible to actually test. They are always changing code that breaks things with no accountability. Client Configurations are always getting messed up. It's impossible to test a product completely. Random error messages every day. It is extremely frustrating to be in this type of environment and you will be stuck waiting for dev/systems to fix issues on a daily basis.



No advancement opportunities within DB - They will gladly allocate you to 120% because they like to ""run lean"", but they don't like to actually recognize employees monetarily. If you ever do get a promotion within the team, don't expect a good pay raise.



Atrocious raises - With each year the raises are getting worse. After leading major projects and putting in a bunch of overtime, I was presented with a 1.5% raise. Others received worse percentages. Make sure you haggle on your starting salary, because you will be at that same pay until you get out of the department.



No incentives - The only incentive is if you are hourly and can work overtime. Otherwise, you won't get recognized and there will be some time of excuse why raises/bonuses are low despite making record profits. I don't know many coworkers that want to stay in the department.



Cheap - When they do encourage team bonding, they make it known that it is NOT funded and that you have to pay. Example - lunch outings with new teammates will be talked about for a week in advance and is highly encouraged to attend, but you will have to pay for yourself. When they used to acknowledge birthdays within the group, the cakes had to be bought personally by management without being able to expense them. 



Benefits - There are health benefits, but they have increased ~220% within 2 years. So you make less money by staying with the company. If you want any type of health reimbursement, you have to track your daily fitness/diet/etc; which they do reimburse $125/quarter, but it is very time consuming



Menial tasks/job - The job itself is very menial. Other departments test a lot more that seem to overlap. You will not build any skills with this position. The hardest part of the job is understanding the complex systems, and when you have a good idea how they should function, they do not actually work. You spend most of your time writing defects. Each environment has limitations that seem to fluctuate per project. You will not build any skills that will help you develop professionally and could hinder future opportunities.



Access issues - There are so many different systems that you need access to. You will not know that you need access to a specific table/environment/program/system until you lose it and can't access something. Then you have to wait days in order for them to give you access permissions again. 



You will be ""voluntold"" to participate in certain tasks that are not related to your role (or even department), have no prior knowledge of and are projected to ""only take 4 hours"", but they end up taking multiple weeks while you still have project work to maintain. That will be on addition to the 120% allocation that you already have for projects as well.

4142,"We are hired for our past successes in planning, sales and relationship management, but then mircro managed and questioned for every single action beyond belief. It is hard to work here and maintain a sense of self respect and dignity! 

~Phone calls are listened-in on by management, and then your conversation with an existing elderly client is called in to question, like, why did you waste 5 minutes talking to her, continuing to build that ""relationship"", and looking up the status of the TOA for her, when you simply could have forwarded her to the call center cust service team? Seriously? Every rep in my branch has suffered a similar type of encroachment.

~Management will occasionally either sit in to observe an appointment, or they will have you dial their extension and listen remotely from their office phone. It is an arbitrary and random decision as to which appointments they ""join"", but really, nothing shakes the confidence of a HNW prospect more than thinking the advisor they are here to see is undergoing some sort to management oversight!! It doesn't matter how well the manager justifies it to the prospect, they are thinking, ""run""!! Every rep in my branch has suffered a failed appointment due to this hideous micro-management.

~Anonymous preaches the relationship model, putting the customer needs first, holistic financial planning, blah blah, then really only cares about what products you ""sold"" to each client. Management is very very short-sighted. An appt where you meet with a multi-million $ prospect preparing for retirement in a few months, building the relationship, developing trust, laying ground work for all future wealth planning, is not regarded as a successful appointment or very good use of your time, because it did not result in actual ""business"" today.

~Anonymous is bombarding their clients with a never-ending barrage of email, mail, just non-stop marketing, all on the S/AE behalf, which drives most clients absolutely nuts.

~They only care about whether or not you are completing the menial ""tasks"", like clicking all the appropriate buttons in siebel. You are tracked and watched and measured on every single little thing you can imagine. How many clicks you clicked. How many times you dialed out...And all your numbers that are tracked are not only to ensure you are being a busy little bee, but the manager is rated on how many little clicks and menial tasks his/her advisors are doing. It's really all about how to make the manager look good to his/her manager!

~Management at the branch level is extremely lame. They want to treat you like a child, and keep you fearful, knowing every little move is being tracked and watched. Like I said, it is hard to maintain a sense of dignity and self respect in an environment like this. Those who can brown nose management, and are otherwise spiteful, political and backstabbing (to fellow colleagues) do well here. Success is: just tell management what they want to hear, and slam clients into products to satisfy management... Those with little talent and integrity stay, endure, and ultimately get promoted, perpetuating the bad leadership. They stay, put up with the games, and endure because they realize they could not make it anywhere else (except, perhaps, on a used car lot). Those with talent, integrity and truly good planning skills leave for a saner environment. 

~Clients in the S/AE book are very frustrated by the fact that every time they get assigned a new S/AE, and they happen to like that advisor and feel that they are working with someone with knowledge and integrity, that advisor ends up leaving. They keep getting turned over, until ultimately, they will end of in the book of one of the talentless, low-integrity bozos that never leave, or, they will just TOA out of Fido.

~Management, by their own admission, have never worked in our S/AE role as it is currently designed. The ""relationship"" model is relatively new, and as reps, they only served customers that were fed to them by the ""green machine"" on a transactional, not relationship, model. I think that disconnect helps explain the double standard; why they focus on tracking/forcing transactional business while falsely preaching relationship development. They like to talk about how successful ""they"" were in the role...but yeah, if all I had to do was take inbound calls and leads, roll the assets over and slap the client in PAS, funds, and/or FILI, then just move on to the next one with no follow up or relationship accountability...well, heck, any moron could do that.",1.0,,"""Micro management, double standards, and politics reign supreme.""",1.0,"~401k and profit sharing are excellent.

4172,"As great as Anonymous is, they are not without fault. Many negative things that I can say about Anonymous, I can also say for other firms as well. The Johnsons are good people. They do a great job at spreading their gospel of customer service, but sometimes the message is lost on middle-management. Middle-management tends to stress too much on day-to-day figures such as Sales, number of calls taken, and the ""customer experience indicator"" (surveys) rather than focusing on the actual interactions that reps are having with customers. 

Managers (especially in sales) also tend to not be entirely clear on what they expect from their employees. My opinion is that this is done intentionally, because they know that they can't coach you to sell something inappropriate that makes them look better on a piece of paper, but oftentimes, they won't call you out on it either if you do in fact do just that. 

Like most big firms, Anonymous can be bureaucratic in many of their operations. The main problem (which is a good problem to have) is that Anonymous is a leader in Employee retirement plans such as 401(k)'s and 403(b)'s and a leader in personal investments such as IRA's. These are technically two separate companies, but under one roof under one name. I've worked in both sides of the house, and it can be annoying to go back and forth with colleagues on the other side of the fence who have these incorrect preconceived notions about your side of the firm. It's exhausting, but it's part of working for a big company. 

Technology is one of the biggest headaches. I can honestly say that while Anonymous invests billions of dollars into technology, much of this is to improve the website. Don't get me wrong, we have a great website for customers, but they don't spend nearly enough money trying to improve quality of life for the employees. Their systems are so complicated, it was almost always easier to tell the customer how to do transaction online rather than through a rep (which is probably what they're aiming for). Also, in this modern world of e-mail, skype, facebook, etc. Many of our employees are still unable to e-mail customers which would be fine if other firms kept the same policy. Other firms have changed with the times. While, I can say that Anonymous is ""on their way."" They've also been ""on their way"" to implementing e-mail correspondence for years now. I mentioned in the Pro's that they are conservative from a legal perspective. This is where some of the cons of being conservative come into play. 

Lastly, middle management is way too politically correct. It's annoying to many employees of all backgrounds. This especially rears its ugly head in the form of reverse discrimination. Being PC is fine as long as you continue to hire good people. Usually Anonymous does a good job in hiring the right people, but occasionally I've seen them compromise just to check a box that they're a diverse firm of employees. This can especially become annoying if you're looking to get promoted.",4.0,"Westlake, TX","""Great place to begin a career in Financial Services""",5.0,"Anonymous does a great job at teaching their employees the basics of financial services. Their benefits are some of the absolute best in the industry as well. 401k plan match is 7% dollar-for-dollar with profit sharing of 10%. Health plans are especially good. The pay is also fair for a discount broker. Ultimately, Anonymous is one of the best places to work in Financial Services, because they have a long tradition of placing top priority on the customer experience. The Johnsons are good people who truly value their customers and their employees. When you are coached, it will be to whether or not the customer's needs were met, not whether you were able to sell them on an inappropriate product. Even working in sales, I always made more money off great customer surveys than I ever did due to sales results (although sales results are important as well). Lastly, the company is very conservative on a number of different topics. You are very unlikely to become involved in litigation working for Anonymous, because they stay as far away from ""the line"" as possible.

4193,"Work environment was lacking. Vacation days (15/year) were okay, but definitely not enough to reward for the amount of work and stress for employees. Amount of sick days (6/year) was absolutely horrendous. A family of 4, like my own, could eat up that amount of time in a matter of months, and I didn't even try to abuse the system.



The area most lacking was employee appreciation. They attempt to appreciate by focusing on some areas (i.e. generous retirement package, perq points, team competitions), but overall falls very short. 



The perq points are based on performance during quarterly competitions. I exceeded goals every competition, but received no more than equivalent of $60 each time. Those who didn't really try and wouldn't meet performance goals would still get about $40 each time. 



My team won about half of the site competitions among teams. We were a very good team. However, the rewards (usually a increase in budget based on head count) would get paid out months after the fact. When it actually did get paid out, for some reason we never seemed to have enough money to do anything fun anyway. Something was amiss in the entire process. Maybe it falls on our manager, maybe the site management. I don't know.



In my 529 college planning specialty role, recently more and more tasks were being added to our plate. It was as if they were using 529 was ""Anonymous Special Forces."" We took on the Canadian Remediation in the summer of 2012, started backing up PAS with their overflow toward the end of 2012, and gradually took more and more general service overflow. When I arrived, 529 had a seasonal workload where it was very heavy during some times of the year, and a little lighter at other times. When I left, we were constantly ""lit"" (meaning calls waiting to get through to us). Most calls we received were general service or something other than 529 calls. The 529 customers were being neglected because we couldn't provide them service in time.



The increased workload would have been fine by me if they would have done a few things:

1. Inform us in advance of how, why, and when the workload is increasing.

2. Provide an increase in compensation (or bonuses or something) since we were not originally hired to do the increased work.

3. Hire more employees to do the peon work of general service. Since they worked us a lot of overtime, you would think that it wouldn't cost as much to hire another employee with a lower salary than to pay me at time-and-a-half with my higher salary.



My last point of review on what was lacking at Anonymous is the career opportunities. Ultimately, EVERYONE needs to go the sales route to accomplish anything. All career paths on the service side reach dead-ends very quickly so employees are stuck with low salaries. My being a non-sales type of person, I realized very quickly that I needed to jump ship.

4282,"Comparatively low salary, unless you come in at a certain level. I was at Anonymous for several years -- in the beginning I was excited to be there, and I got great reviews and I moved up, and I did meet some really good people, so I thought there was a future there for me. But after seeing behind the curtain and realizing every part of the business was messed up, I jumped ship when the opportunity presented itself.



In every business unit I was in, I saw a shocking lack of leadership. Projects are started and stopped in a haphazard, wasteful way based on whichever direction the political wind is blowing. Projects take years to complete when they shouldn't, and sometimes things launch and then they are immediately discarded. Or subpar work -- the standards, when you are talking about technology or communications or design, are way too low for a company of this size and reputation -- is allowed to launch and is weirdly celebrated. The website is terrible, and the technology at Anonymous is frighteningly behind, yet they spend billions on it every year.



Many VPs (and there are oh-so-many) are afraid to say what they think, so naturally everyone underneath them is. People who move slowly and don't make waves are rewarded. People who suggest new ways to approach things are often viewed as threatening by people who have been sitting comfortably in their roosts for too long. Very little actual work gets done and I think Anonymous customers would be shocked to see how much money is wasted by this company on people who are paid way too much for producing way too little by the end of the year. Typically you'll see a business unit with a couple of overworked worker bees and several VPs who go to a lot of meetings but don't do much except talk at each other in meetings and try to figure out how to work the politics.



HR is obsessed with the upper echelon of management, and could care less about the employees. They'll drive themselves crazy over how some memo looks to Executive A or all the SVPs and meanwhile they put very little forethought into a relocation strategy that affects thousands of employees and will bite them in the long run. For example, how many future genius fixed income portfolio managers will sign up to work in Merrimack, New Hampshire when they can go to the competitors in New York or London? And how many dollars is this firm saving by outsourcing HTML work to India when the work takes three times as long to be completed because every single piece of it must be explained, checked, and then checked and requested three more times until it is correct (and each round takes 2 weeks)?



The word on the street is with the up-and-coming leadership regime, it's all about the yes-men, and there's no heart there. Some of the old benefits have already disappeared, and most of the people in the know expect that when the Chairman retires, his successor wants to get rid of things like the long-loved employee shares. Believe me, this will happen. 



This company loves layers, and insecure management lets incompetence reign in those layers -- especially directors and VPs -- because they can manipulate those employees or because they're too afraid to fire people who are in over their heads. Management and HR love to market to themselves internally.



Yet Anonymous will continue to make money in spite of this because it has reached a certain size in the marketplace. When I left, I took my money with me because after seeing how the sausage is made, this really isn't the best place to put your money. (Unless you are a high net-worth customer, they push you into the Freedom Funds, which are consistent underperformers.)



It's sad, because from what I understand from people who were there for a really long time, it used to be a really great company. This sentiment is heard around the firm, but I know a lot of people are afraid to leave because they're shackled to the benefits.

Anonymous manages to meet the quota, yet at the same time, save their budget by making sure that employee turnover is pretty high in this office. Instead of spreading in-coming calls evenly among associates, they create separate work units called MU's. A particular MU receives ALL incoming calls with other MU's receiving only spill over workload. As a result, people quit constantly in the overloaded MU who are then replaced by newly recruited associates.

Other questionable business practices also exist in this office. People are randomly given additional reponsibilities or promotions with the promise that they will receive increased pay commensurate with their added duties. Months later, promoted employees are still waiting for their increased pay. The excuse by management is that they are still waiting to see if you can actually do the job. Instead of a salary increase, they try to placate these employees by decreasing their workload by dumping their duties on the overloaded MU. This is a widespread practice throughout this office. They also hire people at level I and give them Level III duties once you are in the job with Level I pay.

Because of the widespread unemployment situation employees grit their teeth and put up with the situation until they can find another job. In my experience with local and international organizations, I have never seen such dishonest business practices as witnessed in this office.

4536,"Anonymous has a lot of legacy software and hardware platforms, so it's not the place to be if you are interested in getting experienced with newer technologies or automation. Anonymous is addicted to faulty systems which require high levels of maintenance and manual effort, because they can get them ""cheaply"" through volume discounts and enterprise licensing. Approximately 15% of your time on the job will be required for mandatory ""ethics"" and ""compliance"" training, double-recording your time and work results in disconnected, deficient, and faulty systems. The ethics training is as much a joke as the company's stated values, which include honesty. As long as you aren't tossing midgets or taking kickbacks, honesty is not even valued (especially amongst management), much less promoted in ANY way. I personally know of managers who are told by upper management to lie to their employees. I'm not sure how ""ethics"" can even exist in such an inherently dishonest environment.

By the time you complete all of the ""mandatory training"" and administrative tasks required, you will be lucky to have 60% of your time left to do your job. They will schedule enough meetings to consume another 20% of your time, but management will still treat it as 100%.  Of course, while trying to complete your job tasks in this remaining 40% of your time, you will also be expected to train offshore staff how to do your job.  The offshore staff is culturally trained to say ""yes"" to everything and then delivering on 10-20% of what they promise.  But it's okay, because they are perceived as being ""cheap labor"", even though they can't seem to work independently and require that you do about 40% of the job for them.  A significant amount of time on the job is also wasted ""shifting gears"", as management is largely incompetent and doesn't understand the costs associated with changing your mind and focus constantly. Often, fake deadlines are created and things given an overblown sense of importance to pressure employees into working late. Many times I have arrived at work and started to work on an ""important"" task perhaps less than 1 hour in duration and still struggled to focus through the constant interruptions to complete this before the end of the work day, which is often late into the evening. My boss interrupts me 6 - 8 times a day for ""emergencies"", and then becomes upset because ""he doesn't know what I am working on"".

Penny-wise and pound foolish, Anonymous purchases systems based solely on the purchase price and doesn't seem to know the 1st thing about TCO (Total Cost of Ownership).  They build lavish and expensive bathrooms, while looking for ways to cut expense reimbursement, benefits, and bonuses, while they make billions shipping American jobs overseas. They have contributed significantly to the infrastructure and economy in India while they add to the unemployment lines domestically.

Talk about a hostile work environment! Making your boss look good here is the only thing that counts. The company's core values are an absolute joke, as is their dental plan, ""ethics"", and ""compliance"" training. Rather than focus on getting results, motivating employees and doing the right thing, managers spend their time sneaking up behind employees to see what's on their computer screen. If they see a similar screen that might have been there 2 hours before, the assumption is made that you have done nothing else within that 2 hour period, even though there are electronic records of all systems usage. Why check when it's easier for them to assume?

Most middle management  has been brainwashed and this is their only professional experience, thus they think and act a like.....very scary if you've worked anywhere else.  If you ever express an opinion or disagree with those folks.....you're permanently branded.  You can do that with the highest levels of management and it would be respected (they are far away and only get to visit a few times a year). 



Employee turnover is unbelievably high (this is good for creating opportunity), however, it's a reflection of how employees are treated.  Management encourages people to be given warnings  to increase job performance vs. rewarding them.   



e.g. You have 10 business goals. You could be doubling your results with nine of them, however, you're just below goal with one that's not up on the list of importantance.  Instead of averaging out your overall performance, they will focus on that one thing again and again. The person who just barely made the goal with all 10 is far better than you are.

Entire groups have been RIFed, regardless of the criticality of their function or their individual performance ratings.  I know of numerous high-quality, highly respected people who have been let go as part of the on-going re-org, so performance, dedication and a good review rating won't save you from a RIF if your group is a focus.  Reviews for bonuses and raises seem to be based less on performance than on the corporate review paradigm, which dictates that a manager must assign a specific number of satisfactory, sub-standard and outstanding ratings (example - a manager with 10 direct reports can be given the directive that of their 10 direct reports, they must have 1 employee rated sub-standard and only 1 rated outstanding.  The other 8 must be rated Proficient/Satisfactory, regardless of performance.  Due to Fido having such a high number of exceptionally bright and dedicated people, who step up when they see a problem, it is fairly common to find groups where the majority (if not all) of the team members deserve an Outstanding rating.  With the existing paradigm, only 1 can receive that rating and receive a fair bonus/raise.  Eight of the others will receive a Proficient/Satisfactory rating and receive very small bonus/raises.  And one of those 10 people will receive a rating of  N ('Needs Improvement'), which prohibits a raise/bonus and tags them as a probability for the next RIF - and you can't internally transfer if you received a rating of N).  Promotions are also tied to review ratings.  Before I left, the policy was that an employee had to receive 2 consecutive reviews of above Satisfactory/Proficient to qualify for a possible promotion.  That did not ensure they would receive the promotion, it just meant that they qualified for a possible promotion, if one was available.

4585,"Middle and upper management appears to have no idea where they are trying to steer the company, so the company swings from taking an idea to the extreme to a complete 180. Today they may be focusing on customer satisfaction and personalizing the interaction and in a few months decide to strip down customer interactions to scripted nonsense.



There are very few outlets for good ideas to arrive at implementation. Although there are feedback channels that may from time to time result in small changes, the bigger process issues or customer/client issues are completely controlled from the top by people who don't understand (and at times take pride in not knowing) what they manage so they don't know how to recognize or fix problems. So something may be a problem for years before somebody decides to do something about it, and even then the ""solution"" may aggravate the problem.



Anonymous is very political. Anonymous is obsessed today with it's brand image to the public, but one thing that is always constant at Anonymous is the constant obsession about your ""brand"". Gossip is taken as gospel and can ruin your brand in a second. What people have to say about you will override your performance in virtually all cases. Many managers would rather sink one of their employee's opportunity for advancement to be able to keep that person's performance in their numbers. A lot of backstabbing and stealing credit occurs.



There's not a lot of advancement opportunity. When the economy was great in 2007 it wasn't that hard. If you were great in your job, you could move on to a slightly better position, and when you did well there, you could move to another slightly improved position, until you were where you wanted to be. Once the economy crashed in 2008 that all stopped. I get it. That happened everywhere. However, it also stopped all discussions of professional development and no effort was made to give opportunities to develop skills for the current role or another. As a result, future promotion will be very difficult because internal candidates won't be as competitive against external candidates.



Recruiting/HR and their processes are absurd. It can take months after applying for a position before you get an interview. You can apply for a role, not hear anything for several months, and then get an email that you have an interview the next day. So you end up with no opportunity to prepare and made no efforts to prepare because you never heard anything back. Feedback from interviews rarely exists or is very generic. Hiring managers are lazy and don't follow through. 



For every great manager there are ten clueless unhelpful managers. It's obvious that middle and upper management have no idea how to manage their people because there's very little accountability or responsibility on the part of front-line managers. Directors believe yelling at people is the only way to manage, so they will yell at their managers when the numbers are bad, and that's pretty much the extent of direction or vision executed at the management level. I have heard several managers complain that they don't feel it's right that their performance is judged based on the performance of the people they manage. Well, that's what managers are there to do. If they aren't managing towards success, then they aren't doing a great job. I understand there are low performers, etc. but when I see managers playing ping pong for hours in the break room, there's not a lot of accountability in the system.



There's a lot of infighting between different business units. Everybody points fingers but nobody takes ownership over problems and fixes them. Customers and employees get stuck in the middle with no way to get out.



Anonymous no longer places a premium on its talent. Since 2008 the company has eliminated whole business groups with no effort to keep around people with tenure with tremendous transferrable skills. It does very little to help grow talent or keep it from leaving. Where a few years ago employees were loyal to the company and that loyalty was returned, the company has completely eliminated that loyalty. As a result, the company keeps losing great talent and keeps hiring new people who underperform and embarass those of us who strive to be great at our jobs. 



While all of the above things are common among businesses and I have, as most people, experienced similar trends at other jobs, what I will point out is that these problems were not institutionalized in a company that performs with mediocrity and accepts laziness in its overall perforamce. Anonymous is a top competitior in its markets and a lot of its strength historically came from the loyalty to and from its employees. Anonymous has worked very hard to treat its employees with indifference and management -- from the very top -- has set the company afloat with no real vision or guidance other than keep trying to make things that don't work struggle to work.",2.0,"Westlake, TX","""Easy to get in, hard to move up""",1.5,"Anonymous does a lot of solid training, considerably more than a lot of competitors in the field.

4668,"-  Probably the worst aspect of working at FTG is the ""high school environment"" and complete lack of professionalism. When you begin working there, the environment smacks of high school popularity groups. Yuck! And it only becomes worse with time. As much as one tries to remain professional it is difficult to avoid being pulled or pushed, one way or another.  I watched the group of support staff ostracize a former team member and leader because that person was promoted to a position that was ancillary to the support tasks. As I said, it is like a group of mean girls in high school and the guys just kind of follow along. What a sad environment.



-There are 'team leaders"" within the support group, and those who are serious about getting their work done and doing an excellent job, easily standout from the rest.  Worst seems to be the bizarre nature of relationships between Senior Management and some of the employees who have been around for along time. These ""older"" support workers as it turns out, started at FTG at the same time as their now manger.  However, once the other person was promoted, and now holds a position of superior management over the first worker, the relationship between the two naturally has an uncomfortable strain even if it is not clearly evident to all. What was most obvious to those of us outside of this type of bizarre relationship is that the people still hanging around among the worker bees could easily see the passive aggressive behavior. In addition when a fresh new employee full of ideas is assigned to work with one of these people, the older worker bees exploit the new employees mercilessly. Since the newcomers are likely on the outside of the group of people, they don't stand a chance and if anything doesn't go as planned, the newcomers end up getting reprimanded by Senior Mgmt. in place of the worker bees. This ultimately creates a watch out for #1 environment in addition to the vicious ""get rid of #2"" nature of the workers. If you work there, always watch your back - trust no one - be friendly, but make no friends - and document everything you do to CYA.



- Poor leadership in management - mgmt. often does not realize (chooses not to realize?)  who is actually shouldering the work and who is slacking off. The nature of the ""you're in"" vs. ""you're out"" environment only serves to undermine anyone speaking up.



- Higher ups laid off the better managers in late 2008; all that left is those who don't draw healthy boundaries nor can they manage their own people because they have way too much on their plates.



- FTG component of Anonymous is shifting more and more of its human resources & capital over to India.

I worked in several different business units during my 9 years with the company, and because the company is simply so huge, I found that if you have a good manager, you'll have a pleasant experience and receive appropriate performance and financial reviews and feedback, etc. BUT if your manager is one of many who are not good at being managers or for whatever reason don't ""click"" with you, it can become a miserable experience. HR tends to side with management, and it's extremely difficult to remove an incompetent or toxic boss from Anonymous.

We are given several metrics that we must meet that grade us on various call aspects; these include: average call time, scheduling efficiency (how closely you fit into a minute by minute schedule daily), and % of time either in available to talk to on a call.  



As reps we are expected to ""put the customer first"" at all times.  They should really rephrase that to ""put the customer first only on that phone call.""  After the call ends, so does any contact that we have with that person.  Why is this a problem?  About 25% of the calls you take are problems that may take awhile to fix.

Also, a POTENTIAL downside is that it is a shift-based role.  Upon completing new hire training, you rank the available shifts from 1 (most desired) to 18 (least desired).

A good friend of mine won a 4-day, company paid trip to the Bahamas as a campaign reward.  Plus, the campaigns are a lot of fun.



The team structure is great.  Nearly all of the managers are incredible.  Some are more hands-on than others, but they all make sure you're developing as a representative and getting the training you need to stay sharp.  



During the summer, things were incredibly slow and we were often offered VTO (Voluntary Time Off), meaning we could request to leave at a certain time of day and take the rest of the day unpaid.  While getting addicted to VTO was extremely hazardous to your paycheck, it was cerrtainly nice to have that option, especially during the summer.



During the winter and tax season, overtime is offered and encouraged.  Unlike VTO, overtime was a paycheck savior.  While it was strongly encouraged, it was not mandatory, meaning you essentially have control over how much you want to make each day.  Because they only offer OT when things are incredibly busy, its pretty safe to say that every hour of OT put in is going to go by very quickly.



Training is INCREDIBLE.  When studying for the Series 7 general security license, you are paid for 20 hours out of the week to study.  If things are slow, you spend half of your day at work studying.  If things are busy, you work through the day and are expected to study at home, and that time is PAID overtime.  Huge win/win.  In my new hire class of 17 people, every single one of us passed the Series 7 on our first try, something largely unheard of in the industry.","Recommends,Approves of CEO",,I worked at Anonymous Investments ,4.0,4.5,Licensed Personal Financial Representative,5.0,"November 25, 2008"

They love people who are completely satisfied being a middle-level contributor or entry-level manager for the rest of their lives, and although they will pay for your graduate degrees, actually going to night school scares the bejesus out of managers and will put you on the fast track to career stagflation -- an interesting paradox where the amount of work given to you rises exponentially and yet your career advancement aspects stagnate.



They will work you to the bone, give you extremely little attention in terms of career guidance and feedback, and will make you feel like you're asking them to donate a kidney whenever you book vacation time or (god forbid) take a sick day.  Essentially you are a highly trained, but easily replaceable, workhorse for them that can be put to sleep when they can find someone in another state or country that will take your job for less money, even if they can't produce the same standards of output.



The CFOs -- yes plural, as Anonymous brands everyone who manages 100 people a CFO of this or that department -- developed a breakthrough management realization; if you don't promote people, you don't have compensation expenses increase.  Targeted goals this year were <3% compensation increases -- inclusive of salary increases from promotions!



It goes without saying the firm is losing most of its top talent.  Unfortunately with salary for individual contributors 40% below market rates to satisfy Anonymous's precondition to feed senior management, top performers get replaced with completely ignorant and unqualified associates when they leave.  As an example to this absurdity, 2 top analysts in a group quit when they were asked to take on additional workload after already working 60 hour weeks on average, despite not having received a promotion in 2-3 years from junior analyst to senior analyst.  Their combined positions were replaced by a ""senior analyst"" who was so inept they could not even figure out how to rename computer files or put paper into a printer (I kid you not), and who had never worked in a financial services role before.

This is readily apparent in the recent turnover among the upper echelons of management and the corresponding restructuring coming to be known as the ""Rodger Lawson"" era by employees.  The executive leadership that built the company over the last 10-15 years is out.  New executive management is in with the focus on cost-cutting that takes no regard for the Anonymous specific institutional knowledge and talent that is a key strength to stability.  The ""private company""  and ""family owned"" environment that made Anonymous a great place to work and employees proud to laud the company to their friends, family and any one who would listen has evaporated.  Executive management failures to properly define goals and thereby engage the talent in the labor pool they possess is abysmal.  Some of the best and brightest with great knowledge and talent were assigned to projects that incoming executive management had no stomach for seeing to completion.  Rather than reassign that best and brightest talent to retain it, a slash and burn has taken place in the form of layoffs in November 2008 that has placed that talent on the market, ripe for other companies to cherry pick.   The new executive management isn't done and layoffs are coming again in first quarter of 2009 to reach some idea of a model organization.

They recently added another HR layer between a candidate and a hiring manager, so now if you want to post you have to go through your manager, an ""internal staffing rep"" who will decide whether you should even be thinking about moving, a staffing rep who will decide if you should be considered for the position, and then finally the hiring manager.  Most of the time the hiring manager never even sees your resume.

- Management is just appalling at all levels. One of the managers said ""depression isn't an illness"", which just sums up their entire attitude

- People are placed in roles that may not suit them (or may not be what they applied for), and are just told to suck it up

- Office politics are a joke

- Bullying is ignored

- Employees are left to stagnate if they annoy the wrong person

- Really old tech, complicated systems, way too slow to upgrade

- Use a lot of obscure tech so it's hard to find solutions online

- WFH policy isn't clear, and some managers only allow seniors to WFH, while others allow anyone who's passed probation.

- People in senior positions just because they've been working there a long time, who have no business being that level at all

- All the interesting work is taken from Ireland and given to US teams

- Dublin offices are way out in Citywest, so not an ideal location

- Bad quality laptops with virtual desktops that keep crashing, meaning it can be impossible to get work done

- Everything is slowed down by pointless bureaucracy

- Terrible canteen with unhealthy food that's listed as healthy

6105,"Hi Folks,



This is an honest review from someone who is been working for 4 Years in this company Anonymous Gurgaon Unitech cyber park office.

Total experience is of 8 Years now.

I have seen this company on all its sections functioning in gurgaon. So i will comment on each dept individually. Myself been part of I.T Technology department, i have worked in development/maintenace and support roles in this company so knows in and out. This review is completely transparent and genuine.





I.T Technology Dept Review: 



1) Only if you join above ""Tech spec/Project Lead"" level i.e 10 plus years this company might be for you otherwise please go to any service based firm even if you are paid little less. The life below the 10 Years guy is a hazardous journey. The people at higher level are sitting for more than a decade,  they do not have any kind of skills ..be it technical/managerial. Pure office politics and not giving credits and demotivation from senior management. Knowledge sharing is not a concept here, only self learning and politics is the mantra.



2) The Support profiles in company L1/L2/L3 ,People in these roles are highly frustrated, There is no learning there are no knowledge sharing sessions between development and support team.The heads of two departments are often on rivalry which leads to suffering of employees only. They do not have work life balance, the shift allowance and oncall support allowance are worst than any other firm. Working in night shift entitles you to a mere 200 rs a day and being oncall for 24 hrs even on weekend from home entitles you to only 350 rs a day. 

The project once developed is made live and the support team is not made aware till the release day what they are going to support in production :):).



2) Zero onsite opportunity, and by chance if there is any(1 week/1 month) they make you travel on sunday night ..reach UK on monday morning directly to join office then dey make you fly back on friday evening after office...as they dont believe on spending even for 1 xtra day to employee....and per diem they give is 28 pounds. Which is lowest.



3) High disparity in salaries within peers. A mid level employee salary difference could be in 1-8 lacs, so you can imagine the disparity level as you go up.



4) Their promotion cycle is July? But the clever HR has declared minimum difference for next role change is 18 months. So that automatically comes to 2 years. And mgmt will obviously take 2 cycles as a concept to promote you so minimum 4 years of waiting for a promotion after ""senior analyst programmer"" which is for 5 plus years itself and ranges to 10 years.



5) Bonus potential. It is part of pkg only and based on rating it is reduced as well . So how they can call it bonus. Next is you have to wait for year end to get it, if you leave between, it is completely surrendered.



6) No HR in the company. There is high shortage of HR. There is no concept of HR meeting of whatsoever. The HR is not available in the company for anything you dont have any HR to discuss any grieviance you have. There is just payroll department. All the HR are contractual ppl passed from colleges..they are kids just for recruitng people, even talking to them feels ashamed of urself.



7) Company itself finding difficult to cut off the extremely highly paid people working in the company since beginning. These people are stuck to company like termites they have packages equivalent to what their team is getting and are not a value to company. So company is slowly trying to get rid of them and past 5 years there has been sacking of people at higher levels quietly.





Operations-Back Office Department Overview:



1) It is worst for Operations / back-office department people.  Long hours.Strict breaks of 60 mins, which are being checked via software which checks the login hours of employee on computer.If the time out is more than 1 hr then he is to be scolded.



2) Worst paid, over worked. Highly uneducated an unprofessional culture in Operations team. So 1 rating for that. Just for sake of getting a job and so called brand name ..you can join Anonymous in operations.

- Hardly any technical or innovation related discussion on the floor, all discussions are about ""what time are you leaving home today""

- Focus on show-off & oiling your manager instead of quality and excellence 

- Use of obsolete technologies whose experience doesn't count in the market anymore

- Too much red tape in the organization. In the name of risk and compliance the management has created a maze instead of simplifying things. If you ever had an yearning for working in a government job, you can get the first hand experience in Anonymous

- Too much restrictions on trading activities. Cannot participate in IPOs

- Pathetic salary structure. For majority of the employees the salary structure is {Basic + HRA(60% of Basic) + Other Allowance (30% of Basic) + Bonus (15%+ depending on designation) ... guess what the only non-taxable component of the whole salary is HRA, that too you can max claim upto 40% of Basic as Bangalore is a non-metro.

- The average bonus payout is 75-80% for the company and again 75-80% based on your performance. So, if your bonus is Rs. 100, you are paid Rs. 100 *.80 (company payout) * .80(your performance) = Rs. 64 you could see for yourself how the company fools you with its bonus calculation

- Zero flow of information and knowledge - The work culture has been designed in such a way that you hardly talk to your team mates as you are mostly an ""individual contributor"". Majority of the time your manager doesn't have a clue on what you are working on and hence don't expect your colleagues to know much of it. 

- In my line of work ""Business Analytics"" they take in good talent pool and make them work on pathetic projects on obsolete tools and technology. Hence, majority of the newbees leave early

- the company is overstaffed with employees, as more FTEs ensures fat bonus of the VP or Sr. Director. Hence, majority of the times employees are sitting idle doing nothing

- Zero growth opportunities

- There are 'Silence Please' boards at multiple places on the floor --- U think I am kidding r8?? Go and check for  yourself

- Sold your house to follow your job to another state two years ago?  Good for you, you can move again this year, right?  

- Involuntary transfer from the East Coast to the Midwest last year?  So sorry, you make too much money, here's a 20% pay cut; you can take the pay cut, or take a severance package at your *new* pay rate.

- Great news!  We eliminated our on-shore development team to save money, so you'll need to work with the new offshore development team to complete your projects.  PS - they're twelve hours ahead, and they aren't allowed to work remotely, so you'll have to work with them during their business hours (9 PM - 5 AM EST).  Make sure you're in the office 8 AM to 6 PM though, wouldn't want to people to think you're slacking.

- Due to the economic climate, there will be no merit or cost-of-living increases this year, and bonuses and incentive programs are being cut for individual contributors.  The good news is, we did manage to scrape up 300 million dollars for off-cycle bonuses for our top 270 executives.

- It's the first Tuesday of the month.  The good new is, it will be way easier to find a parking spot tomorrow.

Also, reassignment and relocation is common. I had 4 different managers and constantly rearranged teams over the course of 2 & 1/2 years. Entire departments were suddenly and unceremoniously laid off, as well. Working on the phones gives you a certain amount of security, because they need people to answer the calls... but, there's not very much opportunity for advancement. When you are on the phones you are pretty much tethered to your phone and your desk until your designated breaks, so you need to have a strong bladder or lay off of the fluids for hours at a time. You don't really get a chance to interact or get to know your co-workers. Meetings were cut down, which cut down on goal monitoring, teambuilding and learning opportunities. The part-timers had very little opportunity to become full-time workers. If you are on an evening shift it is practically a Herculean feat to get moved to the day shift, even if you've worked there for years. However, despite this fact, the company will consistently bring on completely new hires and place THEM on the day shift... meanwhile, they'll tell the tenured evening shift-ers that there are ""no daytime slots"" available at this time, and ask them to please be patient (years into waiting).",2.0,,"""Call Center =  Mind-numbingly slow death""",2.0,"Good Benefits, easy call metrics, easy to learn procedures, ability to learn about investments or benefits side of the business, slightly better pay compared to other call centers in the NC area, pleasant modern decor, very ergonomic desks & chairs, clean facilities, competent co-workers.

6607,"Used to be great in that you were paid according to effort (small bps for products), there was no arguing your performance and you had greater control. Higher salaries seemed great at first, but ultimately muddied the waters on your value. 

Introduction of higher salaries vs. basis point commission for production made the retail channel thick with bureaucracy for the sales force, muddled value interpretation (having to prove you are worthy of your salary), and ultimately allows for back stabbing by direct management, who generally go unchecked while often adding little to nothing by way of support, help, and development.

Focus on numbers solely over development (Sell tons of PAS and FILI or else)

Management now uses fear of losing one's job as motivating tool, rather than true development while masking it with a smile and telling you it is not the case. Managers and sales force seem at odds; kind of like the shipmaster with a whip and the rowers of the boat (it doesn't feel as though you have anyone trying to help you develop, rather just trying to whip your performance for their own bottom line)

Morale has deteriorated dramatically-ask anyone on the sales force

Your career is in the hands of your manager who solely interprets your worth, especially now that sales force is primarily salary.

It started out as a job I woke up and was happy to go to, but ended up a job I dreaded because the focus became random numbers (some that made little sense or seemed arbitrary like the customer satisfaction numbers and contacts) Important, but nonsensical, unclear, and clearly more important to your manager's bottom line. (Customer satisfaction is important to the sales force, the numbers are important to management) Even though no one can make heads or tails of them, sales force gets beaten up over them.

Managers seem to go unchecked, and while they may face pressure from their managers, can easily shift the accountability to the employees sales performance rather than their own lack of support and development.
